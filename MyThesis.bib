  abstract = {PURPOSE This study attempts to determine the associations between postdischarge environmental (PDE) and socioeconomic (SES) factors and early readmission to hospitals. DESIGN AND METHODS This study was a cohort study using the 2001 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey and Medicare claims for the period from 2001 to 2002. The participants were community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries admitted to hospitals, discharged home, and surviving at least 1 year after discharge (n = 1,351). The study measurements were early readmission (within 60 days), PDE factors, and SES factors. PDE factors consisted of having a usual source of care, requiring assistance to see the usual source of care, marital status, living alone, lacking self-management skills, having unmet functional need, having no helpers with activities of daily living, number of living children, and number of levels in the home. SES factors consisted of education, income, and Medicaid enrollment. RESULTS Of the 1,351 beneficiaries, 202 (15.0\%) experienced an early readmission. After adjustment for demographics, health, and functional status, the odds of early readmission were increased by living alone (odds ratio or OR = 1.50, 95\% confidence interval or CI = 1.01-2.24), having unmet functional need (OR = 1.48, 95\% CI = 1.04-2.10), lacking self-management skills (OR = 1.44, 95\% CI = 1.03-2.02), and having limited education (OR = 1.42, 95\% CI = 1.01-2.02). IMPLICATIONS These findings suggest that PDE and SES factors are associated with early readmission. Considering these findings may enhance the targeting of pre-discharge and postdischarge interventions to avert early readmission. Such interventions may include home health services, patient activation, and comprehensive discharge planning.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Caregivers need to understand their health status and the disabilities of the care recipient to engage in effective health management. Infographics tailored with personal health data are a promising approach to facilitating comprehension, particularly for individuals with low health literacy/limited English proficiency. Such approaches may be especially important for dementia caregivers given the high care burden. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Guided by the Health Belief Model and the Data-Frame Theory of Sensemaking, we conducted iterative participatory design sessions with Hispanic family caregivers (N = 16) of persons with dementia. We created multiple prototype infographic designs to display scores on validated instruments of topics such as caregiving burden, overall health, and psychological distress. We retained and refined designs participants judged to be easily comprehensible. Analysis focused on identifying the graphical elements that contributed to the comprehensibility of designs and on evaluating participants' reactions to the designs. RESULTS: Successful infographics used intuitive scaling consistent with caregivers' perspective of dementia as inevitable decline. Participants reacted to infographics by describing the self-management actions they would take to address the health issue at hand. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Tailored infographics supported caregivers' comprehension of their health status and served as cues to engaging in self-management. As such, they should be presented in the context of informational support that can facilitate selection of appropriate next steps. This can mitigate the potential mental and physical health consequences of caregiving and enable caregivers to continue to care for their relatives with dementia with less damage to their own well-being.},

A hierarchical disability indicator was constructed; participants were considered disabled if they reported difficulties with mobility and IADLs or with mobility, IADLs, and ADLs. The association between baseline fast gait speed and its slope of change and disability incidence was examined using joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}\textbf{RESULTS: }Over follow-up, 628 participants (68\% women) developed disability. Mean fast gait speed at baseline was 1.54~m/s, and annual decline was 0.017~m/s. The hazard ratio of disability per standard deviation (SD)~(-0.22~m/s) slower baseline fast gait speed was 1.77 (95\% confidence interval (CI)~=~1.60-1.94) and for one-SD (-0.013~m/s) faster annual decline was 1.38 (95\% CI~=~1.10-1.73) when both parameters were included in a sex- and age-adjusted model. All associations remained statistically significant in multivariable models, except for slope of change when chronic conditions were added to the model; of chronic conditions, dyspnea was the main contributor.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}\textbf{CONCLUSION: }Accelerated decline in fast gait speed was associated with disability independent of baseline fast gait speed. These results confirm the importance of measuring gait speed repeatedly in elderly adults to identify those at higher risk of disability and the need to identify determinants of decline, because they are likely to be targets for prevention and treatment to reduce disability risk.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Despite the perennial popularity of readmission as an indicator of the quality of hospital care, the empiric evidence linking it to process-of-care problems during the prior hospitalization is inconsistent. We devised a conceptual model for the use of unscheduled readmission within 31 days as an indicator of the quality of medical-surgical inpatient care for adults, and then conducted a systematic review of the readmission literature to determine the extent to which the evidence supports the proposed relationships. A fairly complex web of relationships influences the association between the process of inpatient care and early readmission. From the evidence to date, it is impossible to say with confidence that early readmission is or is not a valid and useful quality indicator. In most negative studies, the absence of an association appears to be explainable on the basis of improper study design, omission of important variables, or mis-specification of variables. Variables intervening between or confounding the relationship of the process of inpatient care to early readmission have received inadequate attention in past work. Investigators can use the proposed model and literature review to ensure their work advances the field and puts the hypothesis that early readmission is a valid quality indicator to a rigorous test. This matter has a certain urgency in view of the vast amount of resources that providers and payers devote to monitoring readmission rates and reviewing readmissions.},

However, the metabolic basis for this observation has not been adequately studied in women. Our aim was to examine the association between body mass index, metabolic coronary heart disease risk factors and a predicted 10-year coronary heart disease risk score in a large occupational cohort of women in the U.K.Methods and Results We carried out a cross-sectional survey of cardiovascular risk factors in 14077 women, aged 30--64 years. The main outcome measures were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein(a), fasting blood glucose and a predicted 10-year coronary risk score. Across seven categories of body mass index, i.e. {$<$}20, 20-, 22-, 24-, 26-, 28- and {$\geq$}30kg.m-2, there were highly significant age-adjusted increases in the risk factors (all P{$<$}0{$\cdot$}001), except for a decrease in HDL cholesterol and ApoA1 (all P{$<$}0{$\cdot$}001) and no relationship with lipoprotein(a) (P=0{$\cdot$}05). Based on a multifactorial 10-year coronary heart disease risk estimate, odds ratios for being in the highest quintile of risk for each category of body mass index, were 1 ({$<$}20kg.m-2), 0{$\cdot$}91, 1{$\cdot$}56, 2{$\cdot$}18, 2{$\cdot$}97, 3{$\cdot$}83 and 4{$\cdot$}21 ({$\geq$}30kg.m-2).Conclusions The significant rise in metabolic coronary heart disease risk at 22kg.m-2observed in this study is consistent with prospective epidemiological studies in women which have reported an increase in coronary heart disease mortality starting at 22kg.m-2. However, body mass index was a poor discriminator of women at different levels of coronary heart disease risk. The primary goal of weight loss in individuals should be the correction of dysmetabolism, irrespective of the level of body mass index.}

PATIENTS: All patients (n = 150) aged 65 years old and above who were readmitted within 15 days into the hospital's geriatric unit in the western region of Singapore over a period of 10 months were retrospectively studied. METHODOLOGY: Demographic data, information on patients' medical problems and social environment were gathered from the patients' medical, nursing and therapist records. A control group (n = 103) consisting of patients not readmitted over 15 days were gathered over the same period. RESULTS: The percentage of readmission over the period between 1 January 1999 and 31 October 1999 was (150/1632) 9.2\% (95\% CI, 7.8\% to 10.7\%). There were a total of 150 patients with an equal number of male and female patients. The patients had a mean of 4 medical problems. Cardiovascular disease was noted in 73\% (95\% CI, 65.5\% to 80.2\%) of the patients during the index admissions. They were noted to be ambulatory and were staying with their own families. Half of the patients were discharged from the index admission with no adjustment to their previous care system. The majority of patients (68.7\%; 95\% CI, 59.9\% to 75.4\%) required readmission because of medical problems. Fifty per cent of the patients admitted for a new medical complaint were secondary to sepsis. Thirty per cent (95\% CI, 22.8\% to 38.0\%) of the study population had both medical and social issues. The main predictive factors noted when compared to a control group of 103 patients (using a stepwise logistic regression model) were number of medical problems (P = 0.0128; OR = 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 1.9) and number of previous admissions (P = 0.005; OR = 1.6; 95\% CI, 1.2 to 2.3). CONCLUSION: Unplanned readmissions are relatively common in elderly patients. They cannot be entirely prevented in view of multiple chronic illnesses. Further studies, looking at early detection of medical problems and prevention of nosocomial infections are warranted to decrease the problem of readmissions for this group of elderly.},

The performance of the simplified HOSPITAL score was evaluated according to its overall accuracy, its discriminatory power and its calibration.{\textbar}Thirty-day potentially avoidable readmission rate was 9.7\% (n=11\>307/117\>065 patients discharged). Median of the simplified HOSPITAL score was 3 points (IQR 2-5). Overall accuracy was very good with a Brier score of 0.08 and discriminatory power remained good with a C-statistic of 0.69 (95\% CI 0.68 to 0.69).

All patients were randomly assigned to receive either comprehensive geriatric assessment with follow-up by the interdisciplinary geriatric team at least five times during the first 6 weeks after discharge or the existing discharge procedures. The main outcome measures were functional ability and readmissions. The most important result is that the intervention had a beneficial effect on functional ability among patients who had been hospitalized at a medical ward. This was not the case among patients who had been hospitalized at a geriatric ward. In addition, there was a beneficial effect on functional ability among pulmonary patients and patients with fractures, but not among patients with cardiac failure. The results point at a need for the expertise of the interdisciplinary geriatric team in preparation of discharge among special groups of patients (e.g. home visit, contact to relevant persons in primary care, aids, etc.) and at a need for follow-up visits.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Neonatal sepsis can be either early ({$<$}7 Days) or late-onset {$\geq$}7days) neonatal sepsis depending on the day of the occurrence. Despite the decrement in  early onset neonatal sepsis, there is still an increment in late-onset neonatal  sepsis. Ethiopian demography and health survey report showed an increment in  neonatal mortality in 2019/20. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to  assess the determinants of late-onset neonatal sepsis among neonates admitted to  the neonatal intensive care unit at Arba-Minch general hospital, southern  Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution based study was conducted from March 1, 2021,  to June 30, 2021 in Arba-Minch general hospital. Cases were neonates diagnosed  with late-onset neonatal sepsis with their index mother chart and controls were  neonates admitted with other diagnoses at the same period. Cases and controls  were selected consecutively. Data extraction tool and interview which was  developed by reviewing different kinds of literature was used to collect data.  Data were entered by using Epi data version 3.1software and transformed to  Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25 software for analysis. The  binary logistic regression model was used to assess determinants and variables  with a p-value {$<$}0.2 were transformed to multivariable logistic regression then, a  p-value {$<$} 0.05 with 95\% confidence interval were used to declare significant  association with the outcome variable. RESULT: A total of 180 subjects (60 cases  and 120 controls) were included in this study. The mean age of neonates was 12.1  days with standard deviations of 4.3. Multivariable logistic regression analysis  showed that; history of either sexually transmitted disease /urinary tract  infection [AOR = 9.4; 95\%CI(3.1-28.5)], being preterm (gestational age of {$<$}37  weeks) [AOR = 4.9; 95\%CI (1.7-13.7)], use of endotracheal intubation/mechanical  intubation [AOR = 8.3; 95\%CI (1.8-26.4)]and either mixed types of infant feeding  option or formula feeding before admission [AOR = 12.7; 95\%CI(3.7-42.8)]were  significantly associated with late-onset neonatal sepsis. CONCLUSION AND  RECOMMENDATIONS: This study revealed that antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum  factors have shown an association with late-onset neonatal sepsis. It is  recommended to strengthen counseling and advice to mothers with specific risk  factors of late-onset neonatal sepsis.},

Data were collected with a descriptive information form, the European Health Literacy Scale and a General Health Behaviors Scale. The analysis of the data was carried out using numbers and percentages, the Chi Square test and ordinal regression analysis. We found that the level of health literacy was inadequate in 25.9\% of the study participants, problematic/limited in 41.4\% had, adequate in 23.6\% and excellent in 9.1\%. A statistically significant correlation was found between an adequate level of health literacy and being relatively more educated, having a chronic disease, being able to follow up on health news, reading publications on health and being better able to evaluate one's own health (p {$<$} 0.05). Additionally, a statistically significant correlation was observed between adequate health literacy levels and being in the later stages of the transtheoretical model in terms of general health behaviors in the domains outside of monitoring one's own weight and avoiding the sun (p {$<$} 0.05). The level of adequate health literacy was discovered to be lower in our study than in Europe. Health protective behaviors show an increase among individuals who display an adequate level of health literacy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is one of the most common causes of disease and death among neonates globally. And it made a great contribution to neonatal admission  to intensive care units. To mitigate the ongoing neonatal crisis and accomplish  the goal of sustainable development through a decrease in neonatal mortality,  information from various regions is needed. Despite the considerable burden of  neonatal sepsis in our setting, no prior studies were conducted in the study  area. So, this study aimed to assess the magnitude and associated factors of  neonatal sepsis among neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at  Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Sidama Regional State,  Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was carried out among  287 neonates from March 1, 2020, to April 25, 2020. An interviewer-administered  structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. The data were cleaned,  coded, and entered into Epi Data 3.1 software and exported to Statistical Package  for Social Science (SPSS) software version 23.0 for analysis. Binary logistic  regression analyses were performed to identify variables having a significant  association with neonatal sepsis. A p-value of {$\leq$} 0.05 was considered  statistically significant during multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: The  study found that the~magnitude~of neonatal sepsis was 56\%. The mean age of  neonates was 3.2(SD{\textpm}2.2) days. Around two-fifths (39\%) of neonates were in the  gestational age of {$<$}37 completed weeks. A quarter of mothers(25.8\%) were  delivered through cesarean section. During labor, 251 (87.5\%) mothers had {$\leq$}4  digital vaginal examinations. Moreover, the finding revealed that~mothers who  delivered by cesarean section [AOR = 2.13, 95\% CI (1.090-4.163)]. neonates who  had been resuscitated at birth [AOR = 4.5, 95\% CI (2.083-9.707)], and neonates  who had NG tube inserted [AOR = 4.29, 95\% CI (2.302-8.004)]~were found to be  significantly associated with neonatal sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: The current study  shows that neonatal sepsis was prevalent among more than half of the neonates  admitted to the NICU. Therefore, designing strategies to enhance the aseptic  techniques of professionals in the provision of care and actively and  collaboratively working with cluster health facilities is highly recommended.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Health care reimbursement is increasingly based on quality. Little is known about how clinic-level patient characteristics affect quality, particularly in community health centers (CHCs). METHODS Using data from electronic health records for 4019 diabetic patients from 23 primary care CHCs in the OCHIN practice-based research network, we calculated correlations between a clinic's patient panel characteristics and rates of delivery of diabetes preventive services in 2007. Using regression models, we estimated the proportion of variability in clinics' preventive services rates associated with the variability in the clinics' patient panel characteristics. We also explored whether clinics' performance rates were affected by how patient panel denominators were defined. RESULTS Clinic rates of hemoglobin testing, influenza immunizations, and lipid screening were positively associated with the percentage of patients with continuous health insurance coverage and negatively associated with the percentage of uninsured patients. Microalbumin screening rates were positively associated with the percentage of racial minorities in a clinic's panel. Associations remained consistent with different panel denominators. CONCLUSIONS Clinic variability in delivery rates of preventive services correlates with differences in clinics' patient panel characteristics, particularly the percentage of patients with continuous insurance coverage. Quality scores that do not account for these differences could create disincentives to clinics providing diabetes care for vulnerable patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with low levels of health literacy have less health knowledge, worse self-management of chronic disease, lower use of preventive services, and worse health in cross-sectional studies. We sought to determine whether low health literacy levels independently predict overall and cause-specific mortality. METHODS: We designed a prospective cohort study of 3260 Medicare managed-care enrollees in 4 US metropolitan areas who were interviewed in 1997 to determine their demographic characteristics, chronic conditions, self-reported physical and mental health, and health behaviors. Participants also completed the shortened version of the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. Main outcome measures included all-cause and cause-specific (cardiovascular, cancer, and other) mortality using data from the National Death Index through 2003. RESULTS: The crude mortality rates for participants with adequate (n = 2094), marginal (n = 366), and inadequate (n = 800) health literacy were 18.9\%, 28.7\%, and 39.4\%, respectively (P {$<$} .001). After adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, and baseline health, the hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were 1.52 (95\% confidence interval, 1.26-1.83) and 1.13 (95\% confidence interval, 0.90-1.41) for participants with inadequate and marginal health literacy, respectively, compared with participants with adequate health literacy. In contrast, years of school completed was only weakly associated with mortality in bivariate analyses and was not significant in multivariate models. Participants with inadequate health literacy had higher risk-adjusted rates of cardiovascular death but not of death due to cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Inadequate health literacy, as measured by reading fluency, independently predicts all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death among community-dwelling elderly persons. Reading fluency is a more powerful variable than education for examining the association between socioeconomic status and health.},

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 3,260 community-dwelling adults age 65 and older. Participants were interviewed in 1997 and administered the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults and the Mini Mental Status Examination. Mortality was determined using the National Death Index through 2003. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In multivariate models with only literacy (not cognition), the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.50 (95\% confidence of interval [CI] 1.24-1.81) for inadequate versus adequate literacy. In multivariate models without literacy, delayed recall of 3 items and the ability to serial subtract numbers were associated with higher mortality (e.g., adjusted hazard ratios [AHR] 1.74 [95\% CI 1.30-2.34] for recall of zero versus 3 items, and 1.32 [95\% CI 1.09-1.60] for 0-2 vs 5 correct subtractions). In multivariate analysis with both literacy and cognition, the AHRs for the cognition items were similar, but the AHR for inadequate literacy decreased to 1.27 (95\% CI 1.03 - 1.57). CONCLUSIONS: Both health literacy and cognitive abilities independently predict mortality.

  abstract = {Background: Health inequalities persist between and within European countries. Such inequalities are usually explained by health behaviours and according to the conditions in which people work and live. However, little is known about the relative contribution of these factors to health inequalities in European countries. This paper aims to investigate the independent and joint contribution of a comprehensive set of behavioural, occupational and living conditions factors in explaining social inequalities in self-rated health (SRH). Method: Data from 21 countries was obtained from the 2014 European Social Survey and examined for respondents aged 25--75. Adjusted rate differences (ARD) and adjusted rate risks (ARR), generated from binary logistic regression models, were used to measure health inequalities in SRH and the contribution of behavioural, occupational and living conditions factors. Result: Absolute and relative inequalities in SRH were found in all countries and the magnitude of socio-economic inequalities varied considerably between countries. While factors were found to differentially contribute to the explanation of educational inequalities in different European countries, occupational and living conditions factors emerged as the leading causes of inequalities across most of the countries, contributing both independently and jointly with behavioural factors. Conclusion: The observed shared effects of different factors to health inequalities points to the interdependent nature of occupational, behavioural and living conditions factors. Tackling health inequalities should be a concentred effort that goes beyond interventions focused on single factors.},

  abstract = {The hazard function plays a central role in survival analysis. In a homogeneous population, the distribution of the time to event, described by the hazard, is the same for each individual. Heterogeneity in the distributions can be accounted for by including covariates in a model for the hazard, for instance a proportional hazards model. In this model, individuals with the same value of the covariates will have the same distribution. It is natural to think that not all covariates that are thought to influence the distribution of the survival outcome are included in the model. This implies that there is unobserved heterogeneity; individuals with the same value of the covariates may have different distributions. One way of accounting for this unobserved heterogeneity is to include random effects in the model. In the context of hazard models for time to event outcomes, such random effects are called frailties, and the resulting models are called frailty models. In this tutorial, we study frailty models for survival outcomes. We illustrate how frailties induce selection of healthier individuals among survivors, and show how shared frailties can be used to model positively dependent survival outcomes in clustered data. The Laplace transform of the frailty distribution plays a central role in relating the hazards, conditional on the frailty, to hazards and survival functions observed in a population. Available software, mainly in R, will be discussed, and the use of frailty models is illustrated in two different applications, one on center effects and the other on recurrent events.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dialysis patients who miss treatments are twice as likely to visit emergency departments (EDs) compared to adherent patients; however, prospective studies assessing ED use after missed treatments are limited. This interdisciplinary pilot study aimed to identify social determinants of health (SDOH) associated with missing hemodialysis (HD) and presenting to the ED, and describe resource utilization associated with such visits. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study with a convenience sample of patients presenting to the ED after missing HD (cases); patients at local dialysis centers identified as HD-compliant by their nephrologists served as matched controls. Patients were interviewed with validated instruments capturing associated risk factors, including SDOH. ED resource utilization by cases was determined by chart review. Chi-square tests and ANOVA were used to detect statistically significant group differences. RESULTS: All cases visiting the ED had laboratory and radiographic studies; 40\% needed physician-performed procedures. Mean ED length of stay (LOS) for cases was 17\,h; 76\% of patients were admitted with average LOS of 6\,days. Comparing 25 cases and 24 controls, we found no difference in economic stability, educational attainment, health literacy, family support, or satisfaction with nephrology care. However, cases were more dependent on public transport for dialysis (p\,=\,0.03). Despite comparable comorbidity burdens, cases were more likely to have impaired mobility, physical limitations, and higher severity of pain and depression. (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ED visits after missed HD resulted in elevated LOS and admission rates. Frequently-cited SDOH such as health literacy did not confer significant risk for missing HD. However, pain, physical limitations, and depression were higher among cases. Community-specific collaborations between EDs and dialysis centers would be valuable in identifying risk factors specific to missed HD and ED use, to develop strategies to improve treatment adherence and reduce unnecessary ED utilization.},

  abstract = {This paper contends that a research ethics approach to the regulation of health data research is unhelpful in the era of population-level research and big data because it results in a primary focus on consent (meta-, broad, dynamic and/or specific consent). Two recent guidelines - the 2016 WMA Declaration of Taipei on ethical considerations regarding health databases and biobanks and the revised CIOMS International ethical guidelines for health-related research involving humans - both focus on the growing reliance on health data for research. But as research ethics documents, they remain (to varying degrees) focused on consent and individual control of data use. Many current and future uses of health data make individual consent impractical, if not impossible. Many of the risks of secondary data use apply to communities and stakeholders rather than individual data subjects. Shifting from a research ethics perspective to a public health lens brings a different set of issues into view: how are the benefits and burdens of data use distributed, how can data research empower communities, who has legitimate decision-making capacity? I propose that a public health ethics framework - based on public benefit, proportionality, equity, trust and accountability - provides more appropriate tools for assessing the ethical uses of health data. The main advantage of a public health approach for data research is that it is more likely to foster debate about power, justice and equity and to highlight the complexity of deciding when data use is in the public interest.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multi-drug resistant organisms are an increasingly important cause of neonatal sepsis. AIM: This study aimed to review neonatal sepsis caused by  multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MDRE) in neonates in Johannesburg, South  Africa. METHODS: This was a cross sectional retrospective review of MDRE in  neonates admitted to a tertiary neonatal unit between 1 January 2013 and 31  December 2015. RESULTS: There were 465 infections in 291 neonates. 68.6\% were  very low birth weight ({$<$}\,1500\,g). The median age of infection was 14.0\,days. Risk  factors for MDRE included prematurity (p\,=\,0.01), lower birth weight (p\,=\,0.04),  maternal HIV infection (p\,=\,0.02) and oxygen on day 28 (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). The most  common isolate was Klebsiella pneumoniae (66.2\%). Total MDRE isolates increased  from 0.39 per 1000 neonatal admissions in 2013 to 1.4 per 1000 neonatal  admissions in 2015 (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). There was an increase in carbapenem-resistant  Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) from 2.6\% in 2013 to 8.9\% in 2015 (p\,=\,0.06). Most of  the CRE were New Delhi metallo-{$\beta$} lactamase- (NDM) producers. The all-cause  mortality rate was 33.3\%. Birth weight (p\,=\,0.003), necrotising enterocolitis  (p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and mechanical ventilation (p\,=\,0.007) were significantly associated  with mortality. Serratia marcescens was isolated in 55.2\% of neonates that died.  CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant increase in MDRE in neonatal sepsis during  the study period, with the emergence of CRE. This confirms the urgent need to  intensify antimicrobial stewardship efforts and address infection control and  prevention in neonatal units in LMICs. Overuse of broad- spectrum antibiotics  should be prevented.},

It then examines how these inequalities in COVID-19 are related to existing inequalities in chronic diseases and the social determinants of health, arguing that we are experiencing a syndemic pandemic. It then explores the potential consequences for health inequalities of the lockdown measures implemented internationally as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the likely unequal impacts of the economic crisis. The essay concludes by reflecting on the longer-term public health policy responses needed to ensure that the COVID-19 pandemic does not increase health inequalities for future generations.},

Using a mixed-methods, transformative research approach rooted in grounded theory, we sought to answer these questions: (a) "What is happening? What are people doing?" and (b) "What do these stories indicate? What might they suggest about social justice?" High school students from a community in which 53.4\% speak another language at home were invited to participate in a survey and focus groups. Of 238 survey participants, 57.5\% (n\,=\,137) indicated they assisted with healthcare tasks. When doing so, 81.7\% (n\,=\,112) translated. Common tasks were reading prescriptions and talking to doctors. While some participants cited negative emotions associated with brokering, the net emotion was positive. Focus groups (n\,=\,11) revealed that tasks varied broadly in complexity and type, emotional experiences were dichotomous, and access to interpreting services and other supports was inconsistent. This research adopts an advocacy lens and uses a mixed-methods, transformative research approach rooted in grounded theory to describe and call attention to a social justice phenomenon we call adolescent healthcare brokering. We define adolescent healthcare brokering as young people acting as linguistic interpreters in healthcare situations for themselves and for family members with limited English proficiency (LEP). In such situations, language acts as a barrier to health literacy and access to healthcare [17]. Despite this known barrier, there is a gap in the research regarding how to successfully address this situation (McKee, Paasche-Orlow, Journal of health communication 17(3):7-12, 2012).},

Measurement and improvement of HL level is essential to develop an appropriate health care system. The aim of the study was to (1) conduct a pilot study among the population of Baranya County in Hungary with different socio-economic statuses, (2) evaluate the HL level and (3) found the correlations between socio-economic data, emergency departments' visits, medical history and HL. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study conducted in 2019 with 186 participants, socio-economic status, health status, HL level and knowledge about the triage system were measured. The questionnaire included questions on socio-economic status, previous chronic diseases, and satisfaction with the emergency care system as well as the standardised European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q47). Descriptive statistical analysis (mean, SD, mode) and mathematical statistical analysis (ANOVA, chi(2) test, Pearson Correlations, Two sample t-test) were applied. SPSS 24.0 statistical software was used to analyse the data. Relationships were considered significant at the p\,{$<$}\,0.05 level. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-six people were involved in the research, but 45 of them were excluded (N\,=\,141). The participation rate was 75.8\%. There were significant differences in HL levels by gender and educational level (p\,=\,0.017), health education (p\,=\,0.032) and presence of children in the household (p\,=\,0.049). Educational level (p\,=\,0.002) and type of settlement (p\,=\,0.01) had strong impacts on economic status. We found that 46.1\% of the participants had limited comprehensive HL (cHL) level. This proportion was slightly lower for the disease prevention sub-index (33.3\%). The average cHL index score was 34.8\,{\textpm}\,8.7 points, the average health care sub-index score was 34.6\,{\textpm}\,9.7 points, the average disease prevention sub-index score was 35.8\,{\textpm}\,9.9 points, and the average health promotion sub-index score was 34.2\,{\textpm}\,9.4 points. 46.1\% of the examined population in Hungary had limited HL level. CONCLUSIONS: Socio-economic status has a strong influence on HL level. It is not enough to improve awareness but we need to improve knowledge and cooperation with the doctors and health care system.},

  abstract = {An important obstacle to improving men's health is their apparent reluctance to consult a doctor. US research shows that men with health problems are more likely than women to have had no recent contact with a doctor regardless of income or ethnicity.1 This reluctance means that men often do not seek help until a disease has progressed.2 Late presentation can have serious consequences. For example, deaths from melanoma are 50\% higher in men than women despite a 50\% lower incidence of the disease. So why do men delay seeking help, and what can be done to overcome the problem? Summary points Men do care about health issues but often find it difficult to expresses their fears Men tend to attend their general practitioner later in the course of a condition than women and this phenomenon is exacerbated by social class inequalities Uptake of health information and health services can be improved by making them male friendly, anonymous, and more convenient Better use should be made of services such as NHS Direct, pharmacists, occupational health, and online advice The nature of medical school education and medical training may contribute to potential problems in consultations between male doctors and patients Suicide is now the single greatest cause of death among young men in most of the United Kingdom. One reason that more men die from suicide than women is that men are more likely to choose methods such as hanging or shooting that leave little room for medical intervention. Even so, men are less likely to talk about their problems with their peers or health professionals. Although the Samaritans claim that a large proportion of men have visited their general practitioner in the months before they take their own lives,3 a report by the Men's Health Forum concludes the opposite.

METHODS a transversal study including 14 to 49-year-old women attended by the Family Health Program (FHP). Exclusion criteria were: having been submitted to gynecological examination in less than one year before, and history of recent treatment (in the last three months) for genital infections. An interview including socio-demographic, clinical and behavioral data was applied. Genital specimens were collected for cytology, GRAM bacterioscopy and culture, and urine sample for molecular biological test for Chlamydia trachomatis. RESULTS two hundred and ninety-nine women took part in the study. The median age was 30.0 (interquartile interval: 24;38) years old; the average age of the first intercourse was 17.3 (sd=3.6) years old. The first pregnancy average age was 19.2 (3.9) years old.

Clinical complaints were: genital ulcer (3\%); dysuria (7.7\%); vaginal discharge (46.6\%): pruritus (20\%) and pelvic pain (18\%). Prevalence rates were: Chlamydia trachomatis 7.4\%; gonorrhea 2\%; trichomoniasis 2\%; bacterial vaginosis 21.3\%; candidiasis 9.3\%; and cytological changes suggestive of HPV 3.3\%. In the final logistic regression model, the factors independently associated to genital infections were: abnormal cervical mucus, OR=9.7 (CI95\%=5.6-13.7), previous HIV testing, OR=6.5 (CI95\%=4.0-8.9), having more than one partner during the previous year, OR=3.9 (CI95\%=2.7-5.0), and having more than one partner in life, OR=4.7 (CI95\%=2.4-6.8). CONCLUSIONS results show a high rate of genital infections and the need of preventive measures, such as STD surveys and risk reduction programs for women that look for routine gynecological service.},

  abstract = {Background: Infections by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are a global threat and are particularly common in hospitals. This study was performed to assess the impact of hospital-acquired infections caused by MDROs on morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital stay. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. A sample of adults aged {$>$}/=18 years with a respiratory, urinary, bloodstream, or surgical site infection caused by a multidrug-resistant (cases) or -sensitive (controls) microorganism was selected. Measurements included hospital mortality from all causes (total and 30 days after infection), length of stay (LOS), and 5 indicators of morbidity: intensive care or surgery admissions, number of diagnostic tests after infection, and hospital readmissions or visits to the emergency department within 30 days of discharge. Results: The sample was composed of 324 cases and 676 control patients. Risk of hospital mortality from all causes (hazard ratio [HR], 1.7; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-2.32) and 30 day-mortality after infection (HR, 1.77; 95\% CI, 1.29-2.44) were higher in patients with an MDRO infection. Probability of readmission was also higher (odds ratio [OR], 2.17; 95\% CI, 1.36-3.46) in the case group. Emergency department visits were only significantly higher in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (OR, 2.80; 95\% CI, 1.65-4.74) and in Escherichia coli-resistant infections (OR, 2.28; 95\% CI, 1.32-3.96). Infections by MDRO were not associated with any other outcome. Conclusions: Hospital infections caused by MDROs increase mortality, readmissions, and in some cases, visits to the emergency department compared with those produced by susceptible strains. They do not appear to influence LOS nor the need for hospital admission, intensive care, surgery, or diagnostic tests.},

  abstract = {A pressing question resulting from global warming is how climate change will affect infectious diseases. Answering this question requires research into the effects of weather on the population dynamics of transmission and infection; elucidating these effects, however, has proved difficult due to the challenges of assessing causality from the predominantly observational data available in epidemiological research. Here we show how concepts from causal inference---the sub-field of statistics aiming at inferring causality from data---can guide that research. Through a series of case studies, we illustrate how such concepts can help assess study design and strategically choose a study's location, evaluate and reduce the risk of bias, and interpret the multifaceted effects of meteorological variables on transmission. More broadly, we argue that interdisciplinary approaches based on explicit causal frameworks are crucial for reliably estimating the effect of weather and accurately predicting the consequences of climate change.},

METHODS: To test whether MetS and its physiologic determinants-insulin resistance as measured by homeostasis model assessment score (IR-HOMA), increased inflammation and coagulation factor levels, and elevated blood pressure-are associated with incident frailty, we studied a subcohort of participants from the Cardiovascular Health Study observed from 1989/1990 through 1998/1999: 3141 community-dwelling adults, aged 69 to 74 years, without frailty and illnesses that increase inflammation markers or mimic frailty. The association of baseline MetS, IR-HOMA, levels of inflammation and coagulation factors, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) with time to onset of frailty was adjusted for demographic and psychosocial factors and incident events. Our main outcome measure was incident frailty. RESULTS: Metabolic syndrome was not significantly associated with incident frailty (hazard ratio, 1.16 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-1.57). On the other hand, IR-HOMA and C-reactive protein levels were associated with incident frailty: for every standard deviation increment the hazard ratio for frailty was 1.15 (95\% CI, 1.02-1.31) and 1.16 (95\% CI, 1.02-1.32), respectively. The white blood cell count and factor VIIIc levels had a borderline association. Elevated systolic blood pressure had no association. Similar trends were found for incident prefrailty, a condition that precedes frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Two physiologic components of MetS- IR-HOMA and inflammation-are associated with incident frailty. Based on these results, IR-HOMA can be considered part of a larger process that leads to generalized decline.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health literacy has been found to be a strong predictor of an individuals' health, health behavior and health outcomes. Lower literacy has been linked to problems with the use of preventive services, delayed diagnoses of medical conditions, poor adherence to medical instructions, poor self-management skills, increased mortality risks, poor health outcomes, and higher health care costs. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between oral health literacy (OHL) and oral health status among patients attending a University-affiliated dental clinic. METHODS: A convenience sample of participants was drawn from the dental patients presenting at School of Dental Medicine (SODM), Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). Information about the subjects' demographic details, income, family size, insurance type and smoking history were collected using a data collection form. Data about the patients' periodontal and caries risk assessment, caries experience and periodontal status was extracted from the patients' electronic dental records. The Comprehensive Measure of Oral Health Knowledge (CMOHK) was used to record the oral health literacy. The median CMOHK score was 18, and this was used to categorize the sample into limited OHL ({$\leq$}18) and adequate OHL ({$>$}\,18) groups. A multivariate logistic regression model was built to examine the associations between the various independent variables and OHL levels. RESULTS: Data of 150 respondents were analyzed. More than half of the participants were female (55.3\%) and the majority were Caucasian (60\%). The average age of participants was 53.3~years [standard deviation (SD) 16.8]. Higher percentage of African Americans and individuals with low education had limited OHL levels (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). The mean decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) score for this population was 7.33\,{\textpm}\,2.68. Subjects with limited OHL had significantly higher mean values for missing teeth (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) and lower mean values for filled teeth (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) as compared with subjects with adequate OHL Significantly, higher percentage of subjects with limited OHL had severe periodontitis as compared with those with adequate OHL (p\,=\,0.04). Multivariate analysis found that the periodontal status was significantly associated with the OHL scores (p\,=\,0.015). CONCLUSION: Subjects with limited OHL levels had poorer periodontal health.~Improving the OHL of patients may help in the efforts to improve the adherence to medical instructions, self-management skills and the overall treatment outcomes. Future research could focus on assessing the impact of OHL interventions on the oral health, which could be valuable for clinical practitioners.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore the views of people aged over 70 years on involvement in their primary health care in 11 different European countries. METHODS: Older patients were asked about their views on patient involvement in a face-to-face interview. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed in accordance with the principles of 'qualitative content analysis'. An international code list was used. RESULTS: Four hundred and six primary care patients aged between 70 and 96 years were interviewed. Their views could be categorized into four major groups: doctor-patient interaction, GP related topics, patient related issues and contextual factors. CONCLUSION: People over 70 do want to be involved in their care but their definition of involvement is more focussed on the 'caring relationship', 'person-centred approach' and 'receiving information' than on 'active participation in decision making'. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The desire for involvement in decision making is highly heterogeneous so an individual approach for each patient in the ageing population is needed. Future research and medical education should focus on methods and training to elicit older patients' preferences. The similar views in 11 countries suggest that methods for enhancing patient involvement in older people could be internationally developed and exchanged.},

In the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (2002--2012), 11,391 study participants who were 50--100 years of age at study induction underwent a battery of cognitive tests and provided a range of collateral data. In an analytical sample of 9,204 people (4,982 women), there were 1,488 deaths during follow-up (mean duration, 9.0 years). When we combined scores from 4 cognition tests that represented 3 acknowledged key domains of cognitive functioning (memory, executive function, and processing speed), cognition was inversely associated with deaths from cancer (per each 1-standard-deviation decrease in general cognitive function score, hazard ratio = 1.21, 95\% CI: 1.10, 1.33), cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio = 1.71, 95\% CI: 1.55, 1.89), other causes (hazard ratio = 2.07, 95\% CI: 1.79, 2.40), and respiratory illness (hazard ratio = 2.48, 95\% CI: 2.12, 2.90). Controlling for a range of covariates, such as health behaviors and socioeconomic status, and left-censoring to explore reverse causality had very little impact on the strength of these relationships. These findings indicate that cognitive test scores can provide relatively simple indicators of the risk of death from an array of chronic diseases and that these associations appear to be independent of other commonly assessed risk factors.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), neonatal bacterial infections are mainly caused by Enterobacterales species and Staphylococcus  aureus, which are also the leading causes of mortality directly attributable to  antimicrobial resistance. As bacterial colonization often precedes infection,  better knowledge of colonization is crucial to prevent antibiotic-resistant  neonatal sepsis. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize current evidence on the prevalence of  and factors associated with colonization with third-generation  cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (3GCRE), carbapenem-resistant  Enterobacterales (CRE), and methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) during the  first 3 months of life in LMICs. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science,  and the World Health Organization Global Index Medicus were searched for articles  published from January 1, 2000, through July 29, 2024. STUDY SELECTION: Included  studies were conducted in LMICs and reported prevalence rates or factors  associated with colonization with 3GCRE, CRE, or MRSA in neonates and infants up  to 3 months of age. Outbreak reports were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND  SYNTHESIS: Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment using a Joanna Briggs  Institute tool were performed by 2 independent reviewers. Pooled prevalence for  each pathogen was computed using a random-effects model. Reporting followed the  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline.  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of and factors associated with 3GCRE, CRE,  and MRSA colonization. RESULTS: Of the 3147 articles identified in the search, 67  studies (51 for 3GCRE and CRE and 16 for MRSA) including 17\,152 individuals were  eligible. The pooled prevalence of 3GCRE colonization was 30.2\% (95\% CI,  21.4\%-40.7\%; {$\tau$}2\,=\,1.48; I2\,=\,95.1\%), varying from 18.2\% (95\% CI, 10.8\%-29.1\%) in  nonhospitalized individuals to 48.2\% (95\% CI, 36.4\%-60.2\%) in hospitalized  individuals. The prevalence of CRE colonization was 2.6\% (95\% CI, 0.7\%-8.8\%;  {$\tau$}2\,=\,7.79; I2\,=\,95.6\%), while it was 2.7\% (95\% CI, 1.0\%-6.7\%; {$\tau$}2\,=\,2.58;  I2\,=\,93.5\%) for MRSA. Increased risk of colonization with 3GCRE was associated  with hospital birth (odds ratio [OR], 1.87; 95\% CI, 1.33-2.64), neonatal  antibiotic use (OR, 2.96; 95\% CI, 1.43-6.11), and prolonged rupture of membranes  (OR, 3.86; 95\% CI, 2.19-6.84). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic  review and meta-analysis of antibiotic-resistant pathogen carriage in individuals  aged 0 to 3 months, the pooled prevalence was substantial despite a limited  exposure period. Although high heterogeneity between studies limited  extrapolation of results, the findings highlight the need for further  investigation to identify transmission routes and to design targeted and  effective preventive measures.},

The  significant risk factors were resuscitation (OR 2.70, 95\% CI 1.36 to 5.35), low  birth weight {$<$}1.5\,kg (OR 3.37, 95\% CI 1.59 to 7.13) and 1.5-2.5\,kg (OR 1.36, 95\%  CI 1.01 to 1.83), low Apgar score at the first minute (OR 3.69, 95\% CI 2.34 to  5.81) and fifth minute (OR 2.55, 95\% CI 1.46 to 4.45), prematurity {$<$}37 weeks (OR  1.91, 95\% CI 1.27 to 2.86), no crying at birth (OR 3.49, 95\% CI 1.42 to 8.55),  male sex (OR 1.30, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.67), prolonged labour (OR 1.57, 95\% CI 1.08  to 2.27), premature rupture of membranes (OR 2.15, 95\% CI 1.34 to 3.47), multiple  digital vaginal examinations (OR 2.22, 95\% CI 1.27 to 3.89), meconium-stained  amniotic fluid (OR 2.72, 95\% CI 1.58 to 4.69), intrapartum maternal fever (OR  2.28, 95\% CI 1.18 to 4.39), foul-smelling vaginal discharge (OR 3.31, 95\% CI 2.16  to 5.09) and low socioeconomic status (OR 1.93, 95\% CI 1.11 to 3.35). We found  considerable heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of 11 out of 15 identified risk  factors. CONCLUSION: Multiple risk factors for neonatal sepsis in Sub-Saharan  Africa were identified. We revealed risk factors not listed by the WHO  guidelines. The included studies overall had high risk of bias and high  heterogeneity and thus, additional research of high quality is needed.

  abstract = {Background: Whether the treatment of patients with hypertension who are 80 years of age or older is beneficial is unclear. It has been suggested that antihypertensive therapy may reduce the risk of stroke, despite possibly increasing the risk of death.  Methods: We randomly assigned 3845 patients from Europe, China, Australasia, and Tunisia who were 80 years of age or older and had a sustained systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or more to receive either the diuretic indapamide (sustained release, 1.5 mg) or matching placebo. The angiotensin-converting--enzyme inhibitor perindopril (2 or 4 mg), or matching placebo, was added if necessary to achieve the target blood pressure of 150/80 mm Hg. The primary end point was fatal or nonfatal stroke.  Results: The active-treatment group (1933 patients) and the placebo group (1912 patients) were well matched (mean age, 83.6 years; mean blood pressure while sitting, 173.0/90.8 mm Hg); 11.8\% had a history of cardiovascular disease. Median follow-up was 1.8 years. At 2 years, the mean blood pressure while sitting was 15.0/6.1 mm Hg lower in the active-treatment group than in the placebo group. In an intention-totreat analysis, active treatment was associated with a 30\% reduction in the rate of fatal or nonfatal stroke (95\% confidence interval [CI], -1 to 51; P = 0.06), a 39\% reduc tion in the rate of death from stroke (95\% CI, 1 to 62; P = 0.05), a 21\% reduction in the rate of death from any cause (95\% CI, 4 to 35; P = 0.02), a 23\% reduction in the rate of death from cardiovascular causes (95\% CI, -1 to 40; P = 0.06), and a 64\% re duction in the rate of heart failure (95\% CI, 42 to 78; P{$<$}0.001). Fewer serious adverse events were reported in the active-treatment group (358, vs. 448 in the placebo group; P = 0.001).  Conclusions: The results provide evidence that antihypertensive treatment with indapamide (sustained release), with or without perindopril, in persons 80 years of age or older is beneficial.

Use of antiseptics dates back to the mid-1800s when Ignaz Semmelweis noted a dramatic decrease in periportal sepsis events with appropriate handwashing techniques, later reaffirmed with Lister's use of carbolic acid showing improved infection control and reduction in surgical morbidity. Commonly used antiseptic agents in dermatologic surgery include chlorhexidine, povidone-iodine, chloroxylenol, isopropyl alcohol, hexachlorophene, benzalkonium chloride, and hydrogen peroxide. They should be used for most, if not all, procedures that enter the dermis of the skin or deeper.},

AIMS: To assess the prevalence of late-life depression in the community. METHOD: A systematic review of community-based studies of the prevalence of depression in later life (55+). Literature was analysed by level of caseness at which depression was defined and measured. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies eligible for inclusion were found. The reported prevalence rates vary enormously (0.4-35\%). Arranged according to level of caseness, major depression is relatively rare among the elderly (weighted average prevalence 1.8\%), minor depression is more common (weighted average prevalence 9.8\%), while all depressive syndromes deemed clinically relevant yield an average prevalence of 13.5\%. There is consistent evidence for higher prevalence rates for women and among older people living under adverse socio-economic circumstances. CONCLUSIONS: Depression is common in later life. Methodological differences between studies preclude firm conclusions about cross-cultural and geographical variation. Improving the comparability of epidemiological research constitutes an important step forward.},

The study was a three-armed randomized, single-blind, and controlled trial, with follow-ups at one and two years after interventions. A total of 459 persons aged 80 years or older and still living at home were included in the study. Participants were independent in ADL and without overt cognitive impairment. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. The result shows that both interventions delayed a progression in morbidity, i.e. an increase in CIRS-G score (OR=0.44 for the PHV and OR=0.61 for senior meetings at one year and OR=0.60 for the PHV and OR=0.52 for the senior meetings at two years) and maintained satisfaction with health (OR=0.49 for PHV and OR=0.57 for senior meetings at one year and OR=0.43 for the PHV and OR=0.28 for senior meetings after two years) for up to two years. The intervention senior meetings prevented a decline in self-rated health for up to one year (OR=0.55). However, no significant differences were seen in postponing progression of symptoms in any of the interventions. This study shows that it is possible to postpone a decline in health outcomes measured as morbidity, self-rated health and satisfaction with health in very old persons at risk of frailty. Success factors might be the multi-dimensional and the multi-professional approach in both interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT0087705.},

DESIGN: Institutional-based,  unmatched, case-control study. SETTING: The study was conducted in three public  hospitals (Hawassa University Teaching Hospital, Adare General Hospital and  Hawela Tula Primary Hospital) of Hawassa City, Ethiopia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of  331 (110 cases and 221 controls) neonates with their index mothers were included  in the study from 1 August to 30 September 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: A pretested,  interviewer-administered questionnaire and data extraction checklist were used to  collect data. Data were coded and entered into EpiData V.3.1 before being  exported to SPSS V.20 for analysis. The factors associated with neonatal sepsis  were assessed using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. P  value of less than 0.05 was used to establish statistically significant  association of variables. RESULTS: Caesarean section delivery (adjusted OR  (AOR)=2.56, 95\,\% CI 1.3 to 5.00), maternal anaemia (AOR=2.58, 95\,\% CI 1.45 to  4.6) and lack of vaccination with tetanus toxoid (AOR=3.5, 95\% CI 2.07 to 6.19)  were all identified as factors significantly associated with neonatal sepsis.  CONCLUSIONS: Caesarean section delivery, maternal history of anaemia and lack of  vaccination with tetanus toxoid were found to be risk factors for neonatal  sepsis. Establishing preconception care practice, strengthening the quality of  antenatal care and standardising infection prevention practice are needed to  improve neonatal health.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis, which resulted from bacterial, viral, and fungal invasions of the bloodstream, is the major cause of neonatal mortality and  neurodevelopmental impairment among neonates. It is responsible for more than  one-third of neonatal deaths in Ethiopia. Frequently neonates referred to health  facilities are at high risk of death. Hence, assessing and preventing the  predictors of mortality in neonatal sepsis helps to reduce the burden of neonatal  mortality. OBJECTIVES: To determine predictors of mortality among neonates  admitted with sepsis at Durame general hospital, southern Ethiopia, 2020.  METHODS: Institution-based unmatched case-control study was carried out from  March 8 to 30, 2020, among 219 neonates in Durame general hospital in southern  Ethiopia. Neonates admitted with sepsis and died were considered as cases and  neonates admitted with sepsis and survived (discharged alive) as controls. Cases  were selected by taking the deaths of neonates consecutively among those neonates  admitted with the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. The next immediate three  corresponding controls were selected by lottery method from the Neonatal  Intensive Care Unit (NICU) case registration book. Data was collected by using  structured pretested checklists from neonates' records and then entered into Epi  data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 20. Logistic regression was used to  identify the predictors of mortality. Statistical significance was declared at  P\,{$<$}\,0.05. RESULTS: A total of 55 cases and 164 controls were included in this  study. More than three quarters (81.8\%) of cases had early onset sepsis. The  multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that predictors of mortality in  this study were; poor feeding [AOR\,=\,4.15; 95\% CI (1.64, 10.49)], respiratory  distress [AOR\,=\,2.72; 95\% CI (1.31, 5.61)], estimated gestational age less than  37\,weeks [AOR\,=\,4.64; 95\% CI (2.17, 9.91)], and convulsion [AOR\,=\,3.13; 95\% CI  (1.12, 8.76)]. CONCLUSION: This study showed that prematurity, convulsion, poor  feeding, and respiratory distress were the predictors of sepsis-related neonatal  mortality. It is important to pay attention to septicemic babies with any of the  identified predictors to reduce sepsis-related mortality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is an invasive infection, usually bacterial, and often occurring during the neonatal period (0-28\,days). Neonatal sepsis causes a  high burden of morbidity and mortality in developing countries like Ethiopia.  There are fragmented, inconsistency, and no review has been conducted to report  the magnitude and associated factors of neonatal sepsis in Ethiopia. Thus, this  study aimed to assess the pooled prevalence of neonatal sepsis and its  association with birth weight and gestational age among admitted neonates in  Ethiopia. METHODS: Electronic media searches like PubMed, CINHAL, EMBASE, Google  Scholar, Web of Science, Cochrane library databases and African health science  library were used. All original peer-reviewed papers which reported the  prevalence of neonatal sepsis in Ethiopia were included in this study. Two  reviewers independently extracted the data using a standardized data extraction  format for eligibility and appraised their quality. Data were analyzed using  Stata version 14 software. The pooled prevalence of neonatal sepsis was estimated  with the random-effect model. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed by I (2)  statistics test. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were done to assess the  source of variation between the studies. Egger's test followed by trim and fill  analysis were used to determine publication bias. A sensitivity analysis was  carried out. RESULT: A total of 952 research papers reviewed, of which, eight  studies were finally included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The  random effect pooled prevalence of neonatal sepsis in Ethiopia was 49.98\% (CI:  36.06, 63.90). In subgroup analysis, the pooled estimated neonatal sepsis among  cross-sectional studies was 53.15\% while the cohort was 40.56\%. Newborns with a  birth weight of less than 2.5\,kg were 1.42 times more likely to develop neonatal  sepsis infection compared to normal babies. The odds ratios of preterm babies  were 3.36 to develop neonatal sepsis compared to term infants. CONCLUSION: The  pooled prevalence of neonatal sepsis in Ethiopia was high. Thus, health care  providers should adhere to aseptic precautions while performing procedures,  especially in preterm and low birth weight infants were recommended.},

While patient input would seem important in the face of this uncertainty and variability, little is known about older patients' views of involvement in medication decision making. OBJECTIVE: To explore the views of older adults regarding participation in medication decision making. DESIGN: Qualitative study. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-one persons at least 65 years old who consumed at least one medication were recruited from 3 senior centers and 4 physicians' offices. APPROACH: One-on-one interviews were conducted to uncover participants' perceptions of medication-related decision making through semistructured, open-ended questions. Themes were compared according to the constant comparative method of analysis. RESULTS: The predominant theme that emerged was the variability in perceptions concerning whether it was possible or desirable for patients to participate in prescribing decisions. For some participants, involvement was limited to sharing information. Physician and system factors that were felt to facilitate or impede patient participation included communication skills, the expanding number of medications available, multiple physicians prescribing for the same patient, and a focus on treating numbers. Perceived lack of knowledge, low self-efficacy, and fear were the patient factors mentioned. Both the presence and absence of trust in the prescribing physician were seen as alternatively impeding and enhancing patient participation. Only 1 participant explicitly mentioned patient preference, a cornerstone of shared decision making. CONCLUSIONS: While evolution to greater patient involvement in medication decision making may be possible, and desirable to some older patients, findings suggest that the transition will be challenging.},

Given the confusion in the literature about the key properties of fixed and random effects (FE and RE) models, we present these models' capabilities and limitations. We also discuss the within-between RE model, sometimes misleadingly labelled a `hybrid' model, showing that it is the most general of the three, with all the strengths of the other two. As such, and because it allows for important extensions---notably random slopes---we argue it should be used (as a starting point at least) in all multilevel analyses. We develop the argument through simulations, evaluating how these models cope with some likely mis-specifications. These simulations reveal that (1) failing to include random slopes can generate anticonservative standard errors, and (2) assuming random intercepts are Normally distributed, when they are not, introduces only modest biases. These results strengthen the case for the use of, and need for, these models.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many medical organizations have invested heavily in electronic health record (EHR) and health information exchange (HIE) information systems (IS) to improve medical decision-making and increase efficiency. Despite the potential interoperability advantages of such IS, physicians do not always immediately consult electronic health information, and this decision may result in decreased level of quality of care as well as unnecessary costs. This study sought to reveal the effect of EHR IS use on the physicians' admission decisions. It was hypothesizing the using EHR IS will result in more accurate and informed admission decisions, which will manifest through reduction in single-day admissions and in readmissions within seven days. METHODS: This study used a track log-file analysis of a database containing 281,750 emergency department (ED) referrals in seven main hospitals in Israel. Log-files were generated by the system and provide an objective and unbiased measure of system usage, Thus allowing us to evaluate the contribution of an EHR IS, as well as an HIE network, to decision-makers (physicians). This is done by investigating whether EHR IS lead to improved medical outcomes in the EDs, which are known for their tight time constraints and overcrowding. The impact of EHR IS and HIE network was evaluated by comparing decisions on patients classified by five main differential diagnoses (DDs), made with or without viewing the patients' medical history via the EHR IS. RESULTS: The results indicate a negative relationship between viewing medical history via EHR systems and the number of possibly redundant admissions. Among the DDs, we found information viewed most impactful for gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, and urinary tract infection in reducing readmissions within seven days, and for gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, and chest pain in reducing the single-day admissions' rate. Both indices are key quality measures in the health system. In addition, we found that interoperability (using external information provided online by health suppliers) contributed more to this reduction than local files, which are available only in the specific hospital. Thus, reducing the rate of redundant admissions by using external information produced larger odds ratios (of the {$\beta$} coefficients; e.g. viewing external information on patients resulted in negative associations of 27.2\% regarding readmissions within seven days, and 13\% for single-day admissions as compared with viewing local information on patients respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Viewing medical history via an EHR IS and using HIE network led to a reduction in the number of seven day readmissions and single-day admissions for all patients. Using external medical history may imply a more thorough patient examination that can help eliminate unnecessary admissions. Nevertheless, in most instances physicians did not view medical history at all, probably due to the limited resources available, combined with the stress of rapid turnover in ED units.},

  abstract = {This state-of-the-art handbook will keep researchers and practitioners in gerontology abreast of the newest theories and models of aging. With virtually all new contributors and content, this edition contains 35 chapters by the most highly respected luminaries in the field. It addresses theories and concepts built on cumulative knowledge in four disciplinary areas - biology, psychology, social sciences, and policy and practice - as well as landmark advances in trans-disciplinary science. With its explicit focus on theory, the handbook is unique in providing essential knowledge about primary explanations for aging, spanning from cells to societies. The chapters in the third edition place a strong emphasis on the future of theory development, assessing the current state of theories and providing a roadmap for how theory can shape research, and vice versa, in years to come. Many chapters also address connections between theories and policy or practice. Each set of authors has been asked to consider how theories in their area address matters of diversity and inequalities in aging, and how theories might be revised or tested with these matters in mind. The third edition also contains a new section, "Standing on the Shoulders of Giants", which includes personal essays by senior gerontologists who share their perspectives on the history of ideas in their fields, and on their experiences with the process and prospects of developing good theory. Hallmarks of the third edition: * Highlights important gains in trans-disciplinary theories of aging.* Emphasizes the future of theory development.* Provides insights on theory development from living legends in gerontology.* Examines what human diversity and inequality mean for aging theories.* Emphasizes interconnections between theory, research, intervention, and policy.* Underscores international issues with greater representation of international authors.* Includes section introductions by the editors and associate editors that summarize theoretical developments.

Evidence that health literacy contributes to disparities in health is minimal and based on brief screening instruments that have limited ability to assess health literacy. The purpose of this study was to assess whether health literacy contributes, through mediation, to racial/ethnic and education-related disparities in self-rated health status and preventive health behaviors among older adults. METHODS: We undertook a cross-sectional study of a nationally representative sample of 2,668 US adults aged 65 years and older from the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess for evidence of mediation. RESULTS: Of older adults in the United States, 29\% reported fair or poor health status, and 27\% to 39\% reported not utilizing 3 recommended preventive health care services in the year preceding the assessment (influenza vaccination 27\%, mammography 34\%, dental checkup 39\%). Health literacy and the 4 health outcomes (self-rated health status and utilization of the 3 preventive health care services) varied by race/ethnicity and educational attainment. Regression analyses indicated that, after controlling for potential confounders, health literacy significantly mediated both racial/ethnic and education-related disparities in self-rated health status and receipt of influenza vaccination, but only education-related disparities in receipt of mammography and dental care. CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy contributes to disparities associated with race/ethnicity and educational attainment in self-rated health and some preventive health behaviors among older adults. Interventions addressing low health literacy may reduce these disparities.},

METHODS: A cross sectional, face-to-face questionnaire was administered to 60 caregivers and seven pharmacists in Cape Town, South Africa. Caregivers answered questions related to paracetamol (acetaminophen) labels, inserts and Patient Information Leaflets (PIL). RESULTS: Most study caregivers received labels with the painkillers they purchased. Many pharmacists (43\%) felt that the information provided was ineffective in preventing overdosing. Study caregivers found it difficult to understand the scientific terms in all three mechanisms of information provision. Most respondents (80\%) found the PIL easiest to understand, yet few had received PILs with their purchase. Ten percent of literate respondents were unable to understand the dosage requirements for children. CONCLUSION: Most caregivers are not able to make informed decisions from the information provided with OTC painkillers. This is mostly attributable to limited provision of information and low health literacy. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Written information with OTC medications in simple language and verbal counselling at dispensaries would play a significant role in increasing the health literacy of especially at risk populations of over-dosing their children.},

The developmental model emphasizes that dyadic coping may be different at various phases of the life span, changing temporally at different stages of dealing with the illness as well as unfolding daily as spouses interact around dyadic stressors. In addition, couples engaged in dyadic coping are affected by broad sociocultural factors (culture and gender) as well as more proximal contextual factors (quality of the marital relationship and the specific demands of the chronic illness). The model provides a framework for understanding how couples coping with chronic illness may together appraise and cope with illness during adulthood and for determining when spousal involvement is beneficial or harmful to both patient and spousal adjustment. The developmental-contextual model to dyadic appraisal and coping has numerous research implications for the field, and the authors conclude with specific recommendations for future research.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Psychosocial stress is a suggested risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). The relationship of stress resilience in adolescence with subsequent CHD risk is underinvestigated, so our objective was to assess this and investigate the possible mediating role of physical fitness. METHODS: In this register-based study, 237,980 men born between 1952 and 1956 were followed from 1987 to 2010 using information from Swedish registers. Stress resilience was measured at a compulsory military conscription examination using a semistructured interview with a psychologist. Some 10,581 diagnoses of CHD were identified. Cox regression estimated the association of stress resilience with CHD, with adjustment for established cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Low-stress resilience was associated with increased CHD risk. The association remained after adjustment for physical fitness and other potential confounding and mediating factors, with adjusted HRs (and 95\% CIs) of 1.17 (1.10 to 1.25), with some evidence of mediation by physical fitness. CHD incidence rates per 1000 person-years (and 95\% CIs) for low-stress, medium-stress and high-stress resilience were 2.61 (2.52 to 2.70), 1.97 (1.92 to 2.03) and 1.59 (1.53 to 1.67) respectively. Higher physical fitness was inversely associated with CHD risk; however, this was attenuated by low-stress resilience, shown by interaction testing (p {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low-stress resilience in adolescence was associated with increased risk of CHD in middle age and may diminish the benefit of physical fitness. This represents new evidence of the role of stress resilience in determining risk of CHD and its interrelationship with physical fitness.},

SETTING: Section of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, University Hospital, Malm{\"o}, Sweden. SUBJECTS: Birth cohorts (aged 32-51 years) invited to screening examination (men = 9. 923; women = 4.422) were compared to birth cohorts not invited (men = 6.655; women = 4.290). Mean participation rate in the invited cohorts was 71\% (range 64-78\%). SCREENING EXAMINATION: Between 1974 and 1992 a baseline screening including a physical examination, blood pressure, a questionnaire regarding, e.g. family history, lifestyle, and socio-economic factors, laboratory tests of serum cholesterol, triglycerides, gamma-glutamyl-transferase, blood glucose before and after an oral glucose load, as well as a mammography examination in women, was performed. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects with hypertension; hyperlipidaemia; diabetes or glucose intolerance; high alcohol intake; or, in women, suspicion of breast cancer were referred to special outpatient clinics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total and cause-specific mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke, from the screening examination until the end of 1995, was followed in both the intervention and control groups, using national and/or local registries. RESULTS: Total mortality did not differ significantly between the intervention group and control group. Cause-specific deaths were also similar except for 'other' deaths amongst men being significantly lower in the intervention group, mainly due to a lower mortality from 'other' causes (suicide, alcohol related deaths) in men under 40 years of age at baseline. Women under 40 years of age had a significantly lower mortality from cancer in the intervention group than in the control group. Nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke did not differ between intervention and control group in either sex. Within the invited birth cohorts, nonparticipants had a higher total and cause-specific mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factor screening for major diseases such as cardiovascular disease, alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus and breast cancer, and subsequent treatment of the detected risk factors/diseases - The Malm{\"o} Preventive Project - did not reduce total mortality in the intervention group as a whole. In subjects under 40 years of age at entry, total mortality was lower in the intervention group than in the control group. In men, this seemed to be due to a reduction of alcohol-related deaths, whilst in women death from cancer was reduced.},

We examine regional variation of AH in Switzerland and the factors that determine AH. METHODS: We used hospital service areas, and data from 2008-2010 hospital discharges in Switzerland to examine regional variation in AH. Age and sex standardized AH were the outcome variable, and year of admission, primary care physician density, medical specialist density, rurality, hospital bed density and type of hospital reimbursement system were explanatory variables in our multilevel poisson regression. RESULTS: Regional differences in AH were as high as 12-fold. Poisson regression showed significant increase of all AH over time. There was a significantly lower rate of all AH in areas with more primary care physicians. Rates increased in areas with more specialists. Rates of all AH also increased where the proportion of residences in rural communities increased. Regional hospital capacity and type of hospital reimbursement did not have significant associations. Inconsistent patterns of significant determinants were found for disease specific analyses. CONCLUSION: The identification of regions with high and low AH rates is a starting point for future studies on unwarranted medical procedures, and may help to reduce their incidence. AH have complex multifactorial origins and this study demonstrates that rurality and physician density are relevant determinants. The results are helpful to improve the performance of the outpatient sector with emphasis on local context. Rural and urban differences in health care delivery remain a cause of concern in Switzerland.},

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 31 729 762 index hospital admissions for all conditions in 2013 from the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Nationwide Readmissions Database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: 30 day, all cause, unplanned hospital readmissions. Odds of readmission were compared by patients' age in one year epochs with logistic regression, accounting for sex, payer, length of stay, discharge disposition, number of chronic conditions, reason for and severity of admission, and data clustering by hospital. The middle (45 years) of the age range (0-90+ years) was selected as the age reference group. RESULTS: The 30 day unplanned readmission rate following all US index admissions was 11.6\% (n=3 678 018). Referenced by patients aged 45 years, the adjusted odds ratio for readmission increased between ages 16 and 20 years (from 0.70 (95\% confidence interval 0.68 to 0.71) to 1.04 (1.02 to 1.06)), remained elevated between ages 21 and 44 years (range 1.02 (1.00 to 1.03) to 1.12 (1.10 to 1.14)), steadily decreased between ages 46 and 64 years (range 1.02 (1.00 to 1.04) to 0.91 (0.90 to 0.93)), and decreased abruptly at age 65 years (0.78 (0.77 to 0.79)), after which the odds remained relatively constant with advancing age. Across all ages, multiple chronic conditions were associated with the highest adjusted odds of readmission (for example, 3.67 (3.64 to 3.69) for six or more versus no chronic conditions). Among children, young adults, and middle aged adults, mental health was one of the most common reasons for index admissions that had high adjusted readmission rates ({$>$}/=75th centile). CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of readmission was elevated for children transitioning to adulthood, children and younger adults with mental health disorders, and patients of all ages with multiple chronic conditions. Further attention to the measurement and causes of readmission and opportunities for its reduction in these groups is warranted.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Family caregivers play a significant role in the diagnosis, treatment, and recovery of individuals with cancer. This position paper reviews and links the research on family caregiving and health information with the importance of cancer literacy. METHOD: Review of literature obtained through searching in Academic Search Premier, EBSCO, Communication and Mass Media Complete, PsychArticles, PsycInfo, and Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition library databases. RESULTS: Family members are important sources of health information, informal caregivers who learn and enact medical procedures, and influential aspects of patients' healthcare and treatment decision-making, but are not seriously considered by healthcare practitioners or researchers in terms of assessing and improving health literacy. Further, very few studies have directly examined or acknowledged the potential importance of family caregiver health literacy. CONCLUSION: The extent to which family caregivers can comprehend the health information they receive along with the patient is crucial for the patient to achieve the most successful health outcome. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: To acknowledge the impact that family caregiver health literacy could have on patient health outcomes, targeted practical recommendations for understanding family caregiver health literacy in the cancer context are proposed: (1) family member health literacy should be assessed; (2) close relational partners should be trained as peer health educators; (3) written cancer information should be provided directly to family caregivers; (4) health interactions between family caregivers and patients should be improved; (5) theoretical perspectives into the understanding of family caregiver health literacy should be integrated into practice; and (6) patient and family caregiver health literacy should be improved.},

The purposes of the study were to measure the prevalence of hospital readmissions, to identify possible factors that influence such readmission and to measure the prevalence of readmissions potentially avoidable in Italy. METHODS: A sample of 2289 medical records of patients aged 18 and over admitted for medical or surgical illness at one 502-bed community non-teaching hospital were randomly selected. RESULTS: A total of 2252 patients were included in the final analysis, equaling a response rate of 98.4\%. The overall hospital readmission prevalence within 30 days of discharge was 10.2\%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the proportion of patients readmitted within 30 days of discharge significantly increased regardless of Charlson et al. comorbidity score, among unemployed or retired patients, and in patients in general surgery. A total of 43.7\% hospital readmissions were judged to be potentially avoidable. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that potentially avoidable readmissions were significantly higher in general surgery, in patients referred to hospital by an emergency department physician, and in those with a shortened time between discharge and readmission. CONCLUSION: Additional research on intervention or bundle of interventions applicable to acute inpatient populations that aim to reduce potentially avoidable readmissions is strongly needed, and health care providers are urged to implement evidence-based programs for more cost-effective delivery of health care.},

RESULTS: Age-specific prevalence and incidence rates according to the different constructs as well as the prognostic significance of the different constructs concerning the development of dementia are reported. Furthermore, a brief summary of recent research on possible risk factors for a negative course of mild cognitive impairment is provided.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE(S): To compare the health literacy (HL) of the adult females with SUI complaints in terms of their acceptance or non-acceptance of surgery. METHODS: In this cohort study, the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU- Q47) scores as a measure of health literacy were compared among the two groups of patients who accepted to undergo surgery for SUI and the ones who did not. Demographic features, weight and BMI values, comorbidity, menopausal status, duration and type of UI, socioeconomic characteristics (marital status, educational level, level of income) and HLS-EU- Q47 survey results of the two groups were compared. We also investigated the reasons regarding the acceptance or refusal of SUI surgery. RESULTS: Among the patients who were offered surgery 474\% accepted to undergo operation. Total HLS-EU-Q47 score was 30.04 in the group of patients who accepted surgery and 23.46 in the group who refused surgery. The patients that refused surgery had more often insufficient health literacy level (p=0.001). An excellent health literacy level was higher for patients who agreed to anti-incontinence surgery (p=0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy score of patients with urinary incontinence (UI) who refused surgery was lower than those who accepted surgery. Acceptance of surgery may be increased by providing more understandable and clear information, especially for women with lower HL levels.},

We investigated if young men's cognitive function, measured by intelligence test scores and educational level, as determinants of SES modified associations between body mass index (BMI) and height with the risk of T2D. 369 989 young men from the Danish Conscription Database born between 1939 and 1959 with information on measured height, weight, intelligence test scores, and education were linked to the Danish National Patient Register. During follow-up from 1977 through 2015, T2D was recorded in 32 188 men. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) were estimated by Cox regressions. BMIs below-average (z-scores\,{$\leq$}\,0) were not related to risks of T2D. For BMIs above-average (z-scores\,{$>$}\,0), positive associations between BMI and T2D were slightly stronger among men with higher intelligence test scores or longer educations than among men with lower levels of these factors (p(interaction)-values\,{$<$}\,0.004). Irrespective of BMI, incidence rates of T2D were higher among men with low levels of intelligence test score and education.

While below-average BMI was not associated with T2D risk, above-average BMIs were and these association were stronger among men with high cognitive function. Nevertheless, T2D risk was higher at lower levels of cognitive function throughout the range of BMI. Height was inversely associated with T2D and it was not modified by cognitive function.},

We argue that the effects of such action would be measurable as a greater proportion of unplanned hospital readmissions among patients discharged when the hospital was full than when not. In response, the present study tested this hypothesis by investigating the association between inpatient bed occupancy at the time of hospital discharge and the 30-day readmission rate.{\textbar}The sample included all inpatient admissions from the ED at a 420-bed emergency hospital in southern Sweden during 2011-2012 that resulted in discharge before 1 December 2012. The share of unplanned readmissions within 30 days was computed for levels of inpatient bed occupancy of {$<$}95\%, 95-100\%, 100-105\% and {$>$}105\% at the hour of discharge. A binary logistic regression model was constructed to adjust for age, time of discharge, and other factors that could affect the outcome.{\textbar}In all, 32,811 visits were included in the study, 9.9\% of which resulted in an unplanned readmission within 30 days of discharge. The proportion of readmissions was 9.0\% for occupancy levels of {$<$}95\% at the patient's discharge, 10.2\% for 95-100\% occupancy, 10.8\% for 100-105\% occupancy, and 10.5\% for {$>$}105\% occupancy (p\,=\,0.0001). Results from the multivariate models show that the OR (95\% CI) of readmission was 1.11 (1.01-1.22) for patients discharged at 95-100\% occupancy, 1.17 (1.06-1.29) at 100-105\% occupancy, and 1.15 (0.99-1.34) at {$>$}105\% occupancy.{\textbar}Results indicate that patients discharged from inpatient wards at times of high inpatient bed occupancy experience an increased risk of unplanned readmission within 30 days of discharge.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many health systems across the globe have introduced arrangements to deny payment for patients readmitted to hospital as an emergency. The purpose of this study was to develop an exploratory categorisation based on likely causes of readmission, and then to assess the prevalence of these different types. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 82 million routinely collected National Health Service hospital records in England (2004-2010) was undertaken using anonymised linkage of records at person-level. Numbers of 30-day readmissions were calculated. Exploratory categorisation of readmissions was applied using simple rules relating to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnostic codes for both admission and readmission. RESULTS: There were 5 804 472 emergency 30-day readmissions over a 6-year period, equivalent to 7.0\% of hospital discharges. Readmissions were grouped into hierarchically exclusive categories: potentially preventable readmission (1 739 519 (30.0\% of readmissions)); anticipated but unpredictable readmission (patients with chronic disease or likely to need long-term care; 1 141 987 (19.7\%)); preference-related readmission (53 718 (0.9\%)); artefact of data collection (16 062 (0.3\%)); readmission as a result of accident, coincidence or related to a different body system (1 101 818 (19.0\%)); broadly related readmission (readmission related to the same body system (1 751 368 (30.2\%)). CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory categorisation, a large minority of emergency readmissions (eg, those that are potentially preventable or due to data artefacts) fell into groups potentially amenable to immediate reduction. For other categories, a hospital's ability to reduce emergency readmission is less clear. Reduction strategies and payment incentives must be carefully tailored to achieve stated aims.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Without improving the survival of newborns, meaningful reduction in under-five mortality is difficult. Most neonatal deaths are preventable when  appropriate and timely care is sought. In Ethiopia, there is lack of evidence on  the type and contribution of delays in treatment seeking to neonatal deaths.  METHODS: A community based social autopsy (SA) of 39 neonatal deaths was  conducted from March 16 to 24, 2016 in Dabat Health and Demographic Surveillance  System (HDSS) in northwest Ethiopia. The result was linked with verbal autopsy  (VA) information completed for each of the deaths as part of the ongoing HDSS.  The SA tool was adapted from INDEPTH Network. Three delay model approach was used  to classify the delay types that contributed for the deaths investigated.  Descriptive statistics was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: SA was completed  for 37 (94.9\%) of the 39 neonatal deaths. Of all the deaths, 51.3\% (19/37) of  them occurred within the first 24~h, 75.6\% (28/37) within the first 6~days and  the remaining in 7-28~days. Birth asphyxia was the leading cause of death (34\%)  followed by bacterial sepsis (31\%) and prematurity (16\%). The median time from  recognition of illness to initiation of modern treatment was 1~day (IQR  1-2.5~days). Delay in treatment seeking outside home (delay one) was associated  with 81\% of the deaths. Delay in receiving care at a health facility (delay  three) and delay in transport (delay two) were associated with 16 and 3\% of the  deaths, respectively. The major contributors of death for delay one were  bacterial sepsis (33.3\%), birth asphyxia (30\%), unspecified illness (20\%) and  acute lower respiratory tract illnesses (6.7\%). For delay three, the major causes  of death included birth asphyxia (50\%), prematurity (33.3\%) and bacterial sepsis  (16.7\%). CONCLUSIONS: Delays created at home and at health facility were the  major delays contributing to the death of newborns. More focus has to be given in  improving delays at home and at health facility.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the Berg balance test could be used to predict an elderly person's risk of falling. SUBJECTS: Sixty-six residents of two independent life-care communities, aged 69 to 94 years (X = 79.2, SD = 6.2), participated. METHODS: Subjects completed a questionnaire pertaining to their fall history and activity level. The Berg balance test, consisting of 14 functional subtests, was then administered. Six months later, subjects again completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: Performance of activities of daily living predicted 43\% of the subjects' scores. There was a difference between the subjects who were prone to falling and those who were not prone to falling, but the test demonstrated poor sensitivity for predicting who would fall. The specificity of the test was very strong. The use of an assistive device was a strong predictor of performance on the Berg balance test. No relationship was noted between increasing age and decreasing performance on the Berg balance test. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: Although the Berg balance test demonstrated only 53\% sensitivity, the results support the test developers' use of 45 (out of 56) as a generalized cutoff score. Older adults who scored higher than the cutoff score on the test were less likely to fall than were those adults who scored below the cutoff score. Decreased scores, however, did not predict increased frequency of falls. Results must be viewed cautiously because self-report was the sole means of documenting fall history.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oral azithromycin given during labour reduces carriage of bacteria responsible for neonatal sepsis, including Staphylococcus aureus. However, there  is concern that this may promote drug resistance. OBJECTIVES: Here, we combine  genomic and epidemiological data on S. aureus isolated from mothers and babies in  a randomized intra-partum azithromycin trial (PregnAnZI) to describe bacterial  population dynamics and resistance mechanisms. METHODS: Participants from both  arms of the trial, who carried S. aureus in day 3 and day 28 samples  post-intervention, were included. Sixty-six S. aureus isolates (from 7 mothers  and 10 babies) underwent comparative genome analyses and the data were then  combined with epidemiological data. Trial registration (main trial):  ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01800942. RESULTS: Seven S. aureus STs were  identified, with ST5 dominant (n\:=\:40, 61.0\%), followed by ST15 (n\:=\:11, 17.0\%).  ST5 predominated in the placebo arm (73.0\% versus 49.0\%, P\:=\:0.039) and ST15 in  the azithromycin arm (27.0\% versus 6.0\%, P\:=\:0.022). In azithromycin-resistant  isolates, msr(A) was the main macrolide resistance gene (n\:=\:36, 80\%). Ten study  participants, from both trial arms, acquired azithromycin-resistant S. aureus  after initially harbouring a susceptible isolate. In nine (90\%) of these cases,  the acquired clone was an msr(A)-containing ST5 S. aureus. Long-read sequencing  demonstrated that in ST5, msr(A) was found on an MDR plasmid. CONCLUSIONS: Our  data reveal in this Gambian population the presence of a dominant clone of S.  aureus harbouring plasmid-encoded azithromycin resistance, which was acquired by  participants in both arms of the study. Understanding these resistance dynamics  is crucial to defining the public health drug resistance impacts of azithromycin  prophylaxis given during labour in Africa.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Influenza vaccination is recommended for caregivers of elderly people. In a study aimed at assessing the level of health literacy (HL) in a sample non-familial caregivers in the Florence Health District (Tuscany), data were collected regarding access and adherence to the flu vaccination campaigns. Methods: The sample consists of 47 non-familial paid caregivers. We collected information regarding socio-demographic characteristics, services provided and daily work time, whether or not influenza vaccination was administered for the 2016/2017 season and in the previous three years. The level of HL was assessed through the Newest Vital Sign. Results: 63.8\% of non-familial caregivers have not joined the flu campaigns over the last four years, 14.9\% have been vaccinated only sometimes (in some epidemic seasons), and 21.3\% have received a flu shot in all the seasons investigated. Most of the non-familial caregivers who do not get vaccinated (27.7\%) do not perceive that they are in direct contact with a person at-risk; those who get the vaccine regularly (12.8\%) reported they want to protect the assisted person as motivation for vaccine uptake. Vaccination was not associated with HL. Conclusion: Adhesion to anti-flu vaccination campaigns for these homecare workers has been resulted rather poor. Coverage does not seem to be related with HL level. It seems appropriate to promote extensively flu vaccination among family carers by actively offering the vaccination in appropriate forms, places and times, to avoid serious consequences on elderly people with higher risk of comorbidity and frailty.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a persistently high incidence of adverse events during hospitalization among Medicare beneficiaries. Attributes of vulnerability are prevalent, readily apparent, and therefore potentially useful for recognizing those at greatest risk for hospital adverse events who may benefit most from preventive measures. We sought to identify patient characteristics associated with adverse events that are present early in a hospital stay. METHODS: An interprofessional panel selected characteristics thought to confer risk of hospital adverse events and measurable within the setting of acute illness. A convenience sample of 214 Medicare beneficiaries admitted to a large, academic medical center were included in a quality improvement project to develop risk assessment protocols. The data were subsequently analyzed as a prospective cohort study to test the association of risk factors, assessed within 24 hours of hospital admission, with falls, hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPU) and infections (HAI), adverse drug reactions (ADE) and 30-day readmissions. RESULTS: Mean age = 75(+/-13.4) years. Risk factors with highest prevalence included {$>$}4 active comorbidities (73.8\%), polypharmacy (51.7\%), and anemia (48.1\%). One or more adverse hospital outcomes occurred in 46 patients (21.5\%); 56 patients (26.2\%) were readmitted within 30 days. Cluster analysis described three adverse outcomes: 30-day readmission, and two groups of in-hospital outcomes. Distinct regression models were identified: Weight loss (OR = 3.83; 95\% CI = 1.46, 10.08) and potentially inappropriate medications (OR = 3.05; 95\% CI = 1.19, 7.83) were associated with falls, HAPU, procedural complications, or transfer to intensive care; cognitive impairment (OR = 2.32; 95\% CI = 1.24, 4.37), anemia (OR = 1.87; 95\% CI = 1.00, 3.51) and weight loss (OR = 2.89; 95\% CI = 1.38, 6.07) were associated with HAI, ADE, or length of stay {$>$}7 days; hyponatremia (OR = 3.49; 95\% CI = 1.30, 9.35), prior hospitalization within 30 days (OR = 2.66; 95\% CI = 1.31, 5.43) and functional impairment (OR = 2.05; 95\% CI = 1.02, 4.13) were associated with 30-day readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Patient characteristics recognizable within 24 hours of admission can be used to identify increased risk for adverse events and 30-day readmission.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED: The quality of life during the first 4 months after fracture was estimated in 2,808 fractured patients from 11 countries. Analysis showed that there were significant differences in the quality of life (QoL) loss between countries. Other factors such as QoL prior fracture and hospitalisation also had a significant impact on the QoL loss. INTRODUCTION: The International Costs and Utilities Related to Osteoporotic Fractures Study (ICUROS) was initiated in 2007 with the objective of estimating costs and quality of life related to fractures in several countries worldwide. The ICUROS is ongoing and enrols patients in 11 countries (Australia, Austria, Estonia, France, Italy, Lithuania, Mexico, Russia, Spain, UK and the USA). The objective of this paper is to outline the study design of ICUROS and present results regarding the QoL (measured using the EQ-5D) during the first 4 months after fracture based on the patients that have been thus far enrolled ICUROS. METHODS: ICUROS uses a prospective study design where data (costs and quality of life) are collected in four phases over 18 months after fracture. All countries use the same core case report forms. Quality of life was collected using the EQ-5D instrument and a time trade-off questionnaire. RESULTS: The total sample for the analysis was 2,808 patients (1,273 hip, 987 distal forearm and 548 vertebral fracture). For all fracture types and countries, the QoL was reduced significantly after fracture compared to pre-fracture QoL. A regression analysis showed that there were significant differences in the QoL loss between countries. Also, a higher level of QoL prior to the fracture significantly increased the QoL loss and patients who were hospitalised for their fracture also had a significantly higher loss compared to those who were not. CONCLUSIONS: The findings in this study indicate that there appear to be important variations in the QoL decrements related to fracture between countries.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE The objective of this study was to evaluate the current utilization, the level of endorsement by professional societies, and health technology assessment bodies, as well as the reimbursement levels for bariatric surgery in European countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed an analysis of the indications for bariatric surgery based on national clinical and commissioning guidelines, current utilization of surgery, characteristics of patients who underwent surgery, and reimbursement tariffs in Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Italy, and Sweden. Data were obtained from national patient registries, administrative databases, and published literature for the year 2012. RESULTS Despite clear consensus outlined in clinical guidelines, significant differences were found in the eligibility criteria for surgery. Patients with no significant comorbidities were deemed eligible if they had a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or 50 kg/m(2) in Denmark. Irrespective of the country, patients with comorbidities were eligible if they had a BMI of 35 kg/m(2). The highest utilization of bariatric surgery (number of surgeries per 1 M population) was observed in Belgium (928), Sweden (761), and France (571) while Italy (128), England (117), and Germany (72) had the lowest utilization. There was a strong negative correlation between utilization and average BMI level of the patient population (r\,=\,-.909, p\,=\,0.005). The annual per capita spending on surgery differed significantly between countries, ranging from {$<$}euro{$>$}0.54 in Germany to {$<$}euro{$>$}4.33 in Belgium. CONCLUSIONS There are significant variations in the clinical indications, utilization, and funding of bariatric surgery in European countries.},

Participants completed a brief four item test of functional health literacy, which assessed understanding of written instructions for taking an aspirin tablet.Main outcome measure Time to death, based on all cause mortality through October 2009.Results Health literacy was categorised as high (maximum score, 67.2\%), medium (one error, 20.3\%), or low (more than one error, 12.5\%). During follow-up (mean 5.3 years) 621 deaths occurred: 321 (6.1\%) in the high health literacy category, 143 (9.0\%) in the medium category, and 157 (16.0\%) in the low category. After adjusting for personal characteristics, socioeconomic position, baseline health, and health behaviours, the hazard ratio for all cause mortality for participants with low health literacy was 1.40 (95\% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.72) and with medium health literacy was 1.15 (0.94 to 1.41) compared with participants with high health literacy. Further adjustment for cognitive ability reduced the hazard ratio for low health literacy to 1.26 (1.02 to 1.55).Conclusions A third of older adults in England have difficulties reading and understanding basic health related written information. Poorer understanding is associated with higher mortality. The limited health literacy capabilities within this population have implications for the design and delivery of health related services for older adults in England.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comprehensive programs addressing tailored patient self-management and pharmacotherapy may reduce barriers to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction. METHODS: This is a 2-arm (clinical pharmacist specialist-delivered, telehealth intervention and education control) randomized controlled trial including Veterans with poorly controlled hypertension and/or hypercholesterolemia. Primary outcome was Framingham CVD risk score at 6 and 12 months, with systolic blood pressure; diastolic blood pressure; total cholesterol; low-density lipoprotein; high-density lipoprotein; body mass index; and, for those with diabetes, HbA1c as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Among 428 Veterans, 50\% were African American, 85\% were men, and 33\% had limited health literacy. Relative to the education control group, the clinical pharmacist specialist-delivered intervention did not show a reduction in CVD risk score at 6 months (-1.8, 95\% CI -3.9 to 0.3; P = .10) or 12 months (-0.3, 95\% CI -2.4 to 1.7; P = .74). No differences were seen in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or low-density lipoprotein at 6 or 12 months. We did observe a significant decline in total cholesterol at 6 months (-7.0, 95\% CI -13.4 to -0.6; P = .03) in the intervention relative to education control group. Among patients in the intervention group, 34\% received at least 5 of the 12 planned intervention calls and were considered "compliers." A sensitivity analysis of the "complier average causal effect" of intervention compared to control showed a mean difference in CVD risk score reduction of 5.7 (95\% CI -12.0 to 0.7) at 6 months and -1.7 (95\% CI -7.6 to 4.8) at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased access to pharmacist resources, we did not observe significant improvements in CVD risk for patients randomized to the intervention compared to education control over 12 months. However, the intervention may have positive impact among those who actively participate, particularly in the short term.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: A standardized medication plan for patients has been developed and recently enacted into German law depicting all medicines taken. It can only increase medication safety if patients use and understand it. We evaluated patients' comprehensibility of the medication plan and analyzed potential variables influencing patients' understanding. METHODS: The medication plan template v2.0 was first tested in N = 40 patients, and the "Evaluation Tool to test the handling of the Medication Plan" (ET-MP) was developed, rating patients' understanding from 0 to 100 \%. The cut-off, distinguishing if patients understand the medication plan, was set at 90 \%. The ET-MP was then applied to an amended medication plan questioning N = 40 general internal medicine (GIM) and N = 50 patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). RESULTS: The mean (+/- standard deviation (SD)) age of the study cohort was 69 +/- 13 years, 47 \% female. Patients took 8 +/- 3 drugs chronically. The CHF patients had a lower level of education compared to the GIM group (p = 0.004). The overall ET-MP score was 82 +/- 21 \% (GIM 86 +/- 19 \%, CHF 78 +/- 23 \%; p = 0.16). Forty-three percent achieved a score {$>$}90 \%. A moderate correlation was found between the ET-MP score and the level of education (r = 0.45) and age (r = -0.46), respectively (both p {$<$} 0.001). Cognitively impaired CHF patients (p = 0.03) and patients with advanced CHF (p = 0.006) achieved a lower ET-MP score. In the CHF cohort, signs of depression or a lower level of self-care behaviour were not associated with a lower ET-MP score. CONCLUSION: The ET-MP is suitable to explore patients' understanding of a medication plan. Less than 50 \% of the patients reached a score above 90 \%. Higher age and lower level of education but not the diagnosis of CHF seem to correlate with impaired understanding of the standardized medication plan. In addition to a medication plan, a significant number of patients are in need of further and continuous care to improve medication safety.},

OBJECTIVES: To model patient, primary care and hospital factors associated with readmission and mortality for patients with HF and COPD, to assess the statistical performance of post-discharge emergency department (ED) attendance compared with readmission metrics and to compare all the results for the two conditions. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: English NHS. PARTICIPANTS: All patients admitted to acute non-specialist hospitals as an emergency for HF or COPD. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: One-year mortality and 30-day emergency readmission following the patient's first unplanned admission ('index admission') for HF or COPD. DATA SOURCES: Patient-level data from Hospital Episodes Statistics were combined with publicly available practice- and hospital-level data on performance, patient and staff experience and rehabilitation programme website information. RESULTS: One-year mortality rates were 39.6\% for HF and 24.1\% for COPD and 30-day readmission rates were 19.8\% for HF and 16.5\% for COPD. Most patients were elderly with multiple comorbidities. Patient factors predicting mortality included older age, male sex, white ethnicity, prior missed outpatient appointments, (long) index length of hospital stay (LOS) and several comorbidities.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effect of interdisciplinary primary care teams on the use of health services by patients with multiple chronic conditions is uncertain. This study aimed to measure the effect of guided care teams on multimorbid older patients' use of health services. METHODS: Eligible patients from 3 health care systems in the Baltimore, Maryland-Washington, DC, area were cluster-randomized to receive guided care or usual care for 20 months between November 1, 2006, and June 30, 2008. Eight services of a guided care nurse working in partnership with patients' primary care physicians were provided: comprehensive assessment, evidence-based care planning, monthly monitoring of symptoms and adherence, transitional care, coordination of health care professionals, support for self-management, support for family caregivers, and enhanced access to community services. Outcome measures were frequency of use of emergency departments, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, primary care physician services, and specialty physician services. RESULTS: The study included 850 older patients at high risk for using health care heavily in the future. The only statistically significant overall effect of guided care in the whole sample was a reduction in episodes of home health care (odds ratio, 0.70; 95\% confidence interval, 0.53-0.93). In a preplanned analysis, guided care also reduced skilled nursing facility admissions (odds ratio, 0.53; 95\% confidence interval, 0.31-0.89) and days (0.48; 0.28-0.84) among Kaiser-Permanente patients. CONCLUSIONS: Guided care reduces the use of home health care but has little effect on the use of other health services in the short run. Its positive effect on Kaiser-Permanente patients' use of skilled nursing facilities and other health services is intriguing. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00121940.},

This report reviews studies published since the 1985 CDC guideline (Garner JS, Favero MS. CDC guideline for handwashing and hospital environmental control, 1985. Infect Control 1986;7:231-43) and the 1995 APIC guideline (Larson EL, APIC Guidelines Committee. APIC guideline for handwashing and hand antisepsis in health care settings. Am J Infect Control 1995;23:251-69) were issued and provides an in-depth review of hand-hygiene practices of HCWs, levels of adherence of personnel to recommended handwashing practices, and factors adversely affecting adherence. New studies of the in vivo efficacy of alcohol-based hand rubs and the low incidence of dermatitis associated with their use are reviewed. Recent studies demonstrating the value of multidisciplinary hand-hygiene promotion programs and the potential role of alcohol-based hand rubs in improving hand-hygiene practices are summarized. Recommendations concerning related issues (e.g., the use of surgical hand antiseptics, hand lotions or creams, and wearing of artificial fingernails) are also included.},

The participants were given the Health Literacy Survey - European Union (HLS-EU) scale and the Mini-Mental Test. Results: In this sampling, health literacy was found as "problematic or inadequate" in 85.1\% of the elderly population. Among the health literacy issues, rate of "problematic-inadequate" results was 63.5\% in benefiting from health services, 86.9\% in protection from diseases, and 87.6\% in improvement of health. The issues that older persons feel most inadequate were adult vaccinations and periodic examinations and they felt sufficient in terms of what to do in emergency cases. Conclusion: The older population needs support in health literacy issues particularly related to judgments. It would be appropriate to set up a standard care algorithm in older people.},

We compared the predictive accuracy of the Identification of Seniors at Risk (ISAR), the Flemish version of the Triage Risk Screening Tool (TRST) and Variable Indicative of Placement risk (VIP) in assessing unplanned readmissions. METHODS: We included 213 patients ({$\geq$}65 years), hospitalized following admission to the emergency department. The ISAR, TRST and VIP were administered at admission. Unplanned readmissions were registered by telephone follow-up 14, 30 and 90 days post-discharge. RESULTS: Unplanned readmission rates were 6.8\%, 14.7\% and 23.5\% after 14, 30, and 90 days, respectively. The ISAR showed low to moderate sensitivity (54\%-69\%) and a high negative predictive value ({$\geq$}78\%) at all measurement points. Specificity and positive predictive value were low ({$\leq$}33\% and {$\leq$}24\%, respectively). The TRST had low to moderate sensitivity (42\%-67\%) and a high negative predictive value ({$\geq$}82\%). Specificity and positive predictive value were low ({$\leq$}45\% and {$\leq$}27\%, respectively). The VIP had very low sensitivity ({$\leq$}26\%) and high specificity ({$\geq$}80\%). Its negative predictive value was high ({$\geq$}79\%) and its positive predictive value was low ({$\leq$}22\%). CONCLUSIONS: Due to their moderate to low sensitivity, and low specificity and positive predictive value, none of the instruments was capable of accurately predicting unplanned readmission in older, hospitalized patients. Overall, reducing or increasing the original cut-off value by one point did not result in improved performance. Our findings suggest that these instruments lack the necessary sophistication to capture the complexity of (unplanned) readmissions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low levels of mental health literacy (MHL) have been identified as an important contributor to the mental health treatment gap. Interventions to improve MHL have used traditional media (eg, community talks, print media) and new platforms (eg, the Internet). Evaluations of interventions using conventional media show improvements in MHL improve community recognition of mental illness as well as knowledge, attitude, and intended behaviors toward people having mental illness. However, the potential of new media, such as the Internet, to enhance MHL has yet to be systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVE: Study aims were twofold: (1) To systematically appraise the efficacy of Web-based interventions in improving MHL. (2) To establish if increases in MHL translated into improvement in individual health seeking and health outcomes as well as reductions in stigma toward people with mental illness. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search and appraisal of all original research published between 2000 and 2015 that evaluated Web-based interventions to improve MHL. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were used to report findings. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included: 10 randomized controlled trials and 4 quasi-experimental studies. Seven studies were conducted in Australia. A variety of Web-based interventions were identified ranging from linear, static websites to highly interactive interventions such as social media games. Some Web-based interventions were specifically designed for people living with mental illness whereas others were applicable to the general population. Interventions were more likely to be successful if they included "active ingredients" such as a structured program, were tailored to specific populations, delivered evidenced-based content, and promoted interactivity and experiential learning. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based interventions targeting MHL are more likely to be successful if they include active ingredients. Improvements in MHL see concomitant improvements in health outcomes, especially for individuals with mild to moderate depression. The most promising interventions suited to this cohort appear to be MoodGYM and BluePages, 2 interventions from Australia. However, the relationship between MHL and formal and informal help seeking is less clear; self-stigma appears to be an important mediator with results showing that despite improvements in MHL and community attitudes to mental illness, individuals with mental illness still seek help at relatively low rates. Overall, the Internet is a viable method to improve MHL. Future studies could explore how new technology interfaces (eg, mobile phones vs computers) can help improve MHL, mental health outcomes, and reduce stigma.},

It compares four methods of identifying long-term care facilities with high use of acute hospitalisations by demonstrating four selection methods, identifies key factors to be resolved when deciding which methods to employ, and discusses their appropriateness for different research questions. METHODS: OPAL was a census-type survey of aged care facilities and residents in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2008. It collected information about facility management and resident demographics, needs and care. Survey records (149 aged care facilities, 6271 residents) were linked to hospital and mortality records routinely assembled by health authorities. The main ranking endpoint was acute hospitalisations for diagnoses that were classified as potentially avoidable. Facilities were ranked using 1) simple event counts per person, 2) event rates per year of resident follow-up, 3) statistical model of rates using four predictors, and 4) change in ranks between methods 2) and 3). A generalized mixed model was used for Method 3 to handle the clustered nature of the data. RESULTS: 3048 potentially avoidable hospitalisations were observed during 22 months' follow-up. The same "top ten" facilities were selected by Methods 1 and 2. The statistical model (Method 3), predicting rates from resident and facility characteristics, ranked facilities differently than these two simple methods. The change-in-ranks method identified a very different set of "top ten" facilities. All methods showed a continuum of use, with no clear distinction between facilities with higher use. CONCLUSION: Choice of selection method should depend upon the purpose of selection. To monitor performance during a period of change, a recent simple rate, count per resident, or even count per bed, may suffice. To find high-use facilities regardless of resident needs, recent history of admissions is highly predictive. To target a few high-use facilities that have high rates after considering facility and resident characteristics, model residuals or a large increase in rank may be preferable.}

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To explore the association between the number of medications and mortality in geriatric inpatients taking activities of daily living and comorbidities into account. METHODS: A nationwide population-based cohort study was performed including all patients aged\,{$\geq$}\,65~years admitted to geriatric departments in Denmark during 2005-2014. The outcome of interest was mortality. Activities of daily living using Barthel Index (BI) were measured at admission. National health registers were used to link data on an individual level extracting data on medications, and hospital diseases. Patients were followed to the end of study (31/12/2015), death, or emigration, which ever occurred first. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate crude survival proportions. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed using Cox regression. The multivariable analysis were adjusted for age, marital status, period of hospital admission, BMI, and BI (model 1), and additionally either number of diseases (model 2) or Charlson comorbidity index (model 3). RESULTS: We included 74,603 patients (62.8\% women), with a median age of 83 (interquartile range [IQR] 77-88) years. Patients used a median of 6 (IQR 4-9) medications. Increasing number of medications was associated with increased overall, 30-day, and 1-year mortality in all three multivariable models for both men and women. For each extra medication, the mortality increased by 3\% in women and 4\% in men in the fully adjusted model. CONCLUSION: Increasing number of medications was associated with mortality in this nationwide cohort of geriatric inpatients. Our findings highlight the importance of polypharmacy in older patients with comorbidities.},

The majority of E. coli ESBL infections are represented by urinary tract infections, but they can also cause severe infections, for example, in the blood stream and central nervous system. Since E. coli is a common colonizer of the normal gut microbiota, increasing prevalence of ESBL-producing strains is particularly worrisome. Once disseminated in the community, containment of this resistance type will be challenging. The driver of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (EPE) is debated. Some suggest that the ESBL genes were introduced to particularly successful bacterial clones. Others imply that very successful plasmids drive the rapid dissemination. More research and epidemiological studies of strain types, plasmids and mobile genetic elements are needed for these questions to be answered.

Studies of social networks and associations with well-being have mostly focused on age-restricted samples of older adults or specific geographic areas, thus limiting their generalizability. We analyzed 2 online surveys conducted with RAND's American Life Panel, a national adult life span sample recruited through multiple probability-based approaches. In Survey 1, 496 participants assessed the sizes of their social networks, including the number of close friends, family members, neighbors, and peripheral others. Of those, 287 rated their social satisfaction and well-being on Survey 2. Older participants reported smaller social networks, largely because of reporting fewer peripheral others. Yet older age was associated with better well-being. Although the reported number of close friends was unrelated to age, it was the main driver of well-being across the life span-even after accounting for the number of family members, neighbors, and peripheral others. However, well-being was more strongly related to social satisfaction than to the reported number of close friends-suggesting that it is the perception of relationship quality rather than the perception of relationship quantity that is relevant to reporting better well-being. We discuss implications for social network interventions that aim to promote well-being. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality. Maternal bacterial colonization plays a major role in transmission to the infant,  with potential for subsequent development of neonatal sepsis with maternally  derived strains. AIM: To review the molecular evidence supporting transmission of  multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) from colonized mothers to  their infants and the risk factors for MDR-GNB transmission. METHODS: PubMed and  Scopus were searched for studies investigating the mechanisms, risk factors for  and/or scale of transmission of MDR-GNB from colonized mothers to their infants.  Random effects meta-analyses were performed to determine pooled proportions of  MDR-GNB transmission and the neonatal outcomes of transmission. FINDINGS: Eight  studies were included in the narrative description and six in the meta-analysis.  Five studies used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to assess relatedness of  isolates from colonized mothers and their infants. Pooled proportion of MDR-GNB  transmission from colonized mothers to their infants was 27\% (95\% confidence  interval (CI): 8-47\%). Extended-spectrum {$\beta$}-lactamase (ESBL)-producing  Enterobacteriaceae were the most frequently studied MDR-GNB pathogens transmitted  between mother-infant pairs. Following mother-to-infant transmission of an  MDR-GNB pathogen, the pooled proportion for the outcome of neonatal colonization  was 19\% (95\% CI: 3-35\%). CONCLUSION: This systematic review strongly supports MDR  and/or ESBL Enterobacteriaceae transmission from colonized mothers to their  infants, with subsequent infant colonization. The risk factors contributing to  transmission of MDR-GNB between colonized mothers and their infants warrants  further research.},

The aim of this trial is to investigate the effect of active treatment on stroke incidence in hypertensive patients over the age of 80 years. Secondary end-points include total cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Entry criteria include a sustained sitting systolic blood pressure of 160 to 219mm Hg plus a sustained sitting diastolic pressure of 95 to 109mm Hg. Also required is a standing systolic blood pressure of at least 140mm Hg. Patients must give their informed consent, and be free of congestive heart failure requiring treatment, gout, renal failure or a recent cerebral haemorrhage. Patients are to be randomised to 3 groups-(i) no treatment; (ii) treatment with a diuretic [bendroflumethiazide (bendrofluazide)]; or (iii) treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril). Starting dosage for bendroflumethiazide and lisinopril is 2.5 mg/day. In order to achieve goal sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures ({$<$} 150/80 mm Hg), a doubling of the dosage is allowed. Furthermore, slow release diltiazem (120 mg/day increasing to 240 mg/day if required) may be added to the medication of the actively treated groups. These drugs have been chosen as inexpensive and appropriate representatives of their therapeutic classes. 700 patients in each group (a total of 2100) will be sufficient to detect a 40\% difference in cerebrovascular events between no treatment and active treatment (alpha = 0.01, 1-beta = 0.90). These numbers will also detect a difference in total mortality of 25\% and in cardiovascular mortality of 35\%.

The initiation or/and discontinuation of the empirical antibiotic  therapy at neonates with sepsis is a dilemma due to the lack of definitive  diagnosis and the fear of misdiagnosing a case with its serious outcomes, which  can follow up. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the usefulness of C-reactive  protein (CRP) as an inflammatory biomarker in the prediction of the neonatal  sepsis diagnosis in Butembo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in sub-Saharan  Africa. Blood culture and quantitative CRP measurements were performed for each  neonate. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were done in the  assessment of CRP accuracy in diagnosing neonatal sepsis. RESULTS: Of the 228  neonates screened for sepsis, 69 (30.3\%) had a positive blood culture. Of the 228  neonates with suspected sepsis, 94 (41.2\%) had a positive CRP. Among the 69 cases  with positive blood culture, CRP identified 66 cases. The sensitivity,  specificity, positive and negative predictive values of CRP were 95.7\%, 82.4\%,  70.2\%, and 97.8\%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for the CRP ROC  analysis was 0.948. CRP showed its usefulness in the diagnosis of neonatal  sepsis.},

As preventive care and early treatment are often carried out in the ambulatory setting, ACSH have come to be viewed as an indicator of quality for this sector of the health-care system.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHOD: Factors potentially influencing the regional distribution of ACSH were examined for four conditions-congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, arterial hypertension, and diabetes mellitus-with separate analyses for men and women. A regression analysis was performed on the basis of German nationwide data for the year 2008 (hospital statistics and population statistics). The data covered all areas of Germany.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Each rise in the density of practice based specialists by 1 per 100 000 inhabitants was associated with a 0.1\% reduction of ACSH in general and with a 0.3\% reduction of ACSH for diabetes among men. A corresponding rise in the density of general practitioners was associated with reductions of ACSH among men by 0.1\% for heart failure and by 0.5\% for hypertension, yet also with increases of ACSH for angina pectoris (0.2\% rise) and for diabetes (0.4\% rise). Unemployment, residency in a rural area, and the number of hospital beds available locally were all positively correlated with small rises the ACSH rate. An age of 65 years and older was associated with the highest ACSH rates (0.7\% to 3.6\%).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: Overall, the analyzed variables were only weakly associated with the frequency of ambulatory care sensitive hospitalization. Future studies should consider further aspects such as the quality of care, comorbidities, and participation in healthcare programs.},

PARTICIPANTS/EXPOSURES: All consecutive adult medical patients discharged alive in 2011 with 1 of the 4 medical conditions targeted by the HRRP (acute myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, and heart failure) were included. Potentially preventable 30-day readmissions were identified using the SQLape algorithm. The HOSPITAL score was calculated for all patients. MEASUREMENTS: A multivariable logistic regression model accounting for hospital effects was used to evaluate the accuracy (Brier score), discrimination (c-statistic), and calibration (Pearson goodness-of-fit) of the HOSPITAL score for each 4 medical conditions. RESULTS: Among the 9181 patients included, the overall 30-day potentially preventable readmission rate was 13.6\%. Across all 4 diagnoses, the HOSPITAL score had very good accuracy (Brier score of 0.11), good discrimination (c-statistic of 0.68), and excellent calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, P=0.77). Within each diagnosis, performance was similar. In sensitivity analyses, performance was similar for all readmissions (not just potentially preventable) and when restricted to patients age 65 and above. CONCLUSIONS: The HOSPITAL score identifies a high-risk cohort for potentially preventable readmissions in a variety of practice settings, including conditions targeted by the HRRP. It may be a valuable tool when included in interventions to reduce readmissions within or across these conditions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cancer imposes higher burden on men. Sex differences in healthcare utilization may contribute to this problem. We compared healthcare utilization among adults with and without a history of cancer as measured by having at least one physician visit within the previous 12 months. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed data from 7,229 responders (weighted population size=211,722,892) enrolled in the 2007 Health Information and National Trends Survey (HINTS), a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized adults in the United States. We used survey weights in all analyses and variance estimation procedures to account for the complex survey design and used logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Study participants consisted of 2808 (48.6\%) males and 4421 (51.4\%) females. Overall, men were less likely to have seen a physician within the previous 12 months (OR=0.39; 95\% CI: 0.31-0.48) regardless of their cancer status. Cancer survivors were more likely to visit a physician within the previous 12 months (OR=2.01; 95\% CI: 1.28-3.19) regardless of sex. When stratified by personal history of cancer, men without a history of cancer were less likely to visit a physician (OR=0.38; 95\% CI: 0.30-0.47) whereas men with a history of cancer were as likely to have seen a physician in the previous 12 months as women with similar cancer status (OR=1.24; 95\% CI: 0.44-3.45). CONCLUSION: Men increase their healthcare utilization to that of women only after they receive diagnosis of cancer. Targeted interventions to promote utilization of preventive care services by men are needed to reduce the burden of chronic illnesses including cancer among men.},

Rural areas experience barriers to care primarily due to a lack of resources, including education, health insurance, transportation, and social support. Additionally, poor health outcomes are a consequence of poor health literacy skills. Community Health Workers (CHWs) are utilized as a resource to combat these issues. This study focused on a CHW led Self-Management Blood Pressure (SMBP) program offered through the University of Texas at Tyler Health Science Center. The goal of the program was to improve management of hypertension through awareness, education, navigation, advocacy, and resource assistance. The SMBP program included structured workshops and regular follow-up with participants including connections to community resources and social support. CHWs worked closely with physicians providing bi-directional feedback on referrals and engagement of communities through outreach events. Furthermore, CHWs aided to bridge cultural or linguistic gaps between service providers and community members. Data is provided indicating this CHW-led intervention played a significant role in improving hypertension through education of how to make lifestyle changes that impact overall health and quality of life. Participants gained knowledge encouraging them to create lifelong healthy habits, coping skills, stress management, self-care, and accountability. Through this innovative approach, participants thrived in the supportive and encouraging environment led by CHWs as well as improved their blood pressure management.},

  abstract = {Introduction Evidence from longitudinal studies on the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation in older age on the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is limited. This study investigates the prospective associations of neighborhood-level deprivation and individual socioeconomic position (SEP) with T2DM incidence in older age. Research design and methods The British Regional Heart Study studied 4252 men aged 60--79 years in 1998--2000. Neighborhood-level deprivation was based on the Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles for participants' 1998--2000 residential postcode. Individual SEP was defined as social class based on longest-held occupation. A cumulative score of individual socioeconomic factors was derived. Incident T2DM cases were ascertained from primary care records; prevalent cases were excluded. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the associations. Results Among 3706 men, 368 incident cases of T2DM were observed over 18 years. The age-adjusted T2DM risk increased from the least deprived quintile to the most deprived: HR per quintile increase 1.14 (95\% CI 1.06 to 1.23) (p=0.0005). The age-adjusted T2DM HR in social class V (lowest) versus social class I (highest) was 2.45 (95\% CI 1.36 to 4.42) (p=0.001). Both associations attenuated but remained significant on adjustment for other deprivation measures, becoming non-significant on adjustment for body mass index and T2DM family history. T2DM risk increased with cumulative individual adverse socioeconomic factors: HR per point increase 1.14 (95\% CI 1.05 to 1.24). Conclusions Inequalities in T2DM risk persist in later life, both in relation to neighborhood-level and individual-level socioeconomic factors. Underlying modifiable risk factors continue to need to be addressed in deprived older age populations to reduce disease burden.},

  abstract = {Although elderly Iranian immigrants in Sweden are the largest elderly group born outside Europe, little is known about their health-related quality of life (HRQL). The aim of this study was to examine the association between migration status and HRQL in a comparison of elderly Iranians in Iran, elderly Iranian immigrants in Sweden, and elderly Swedes in Sweden. The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) was administered to a total of 625 men and women aged 60--84 years to collect HRQL information on elderly Iranians in Sweden (n = 176) and elderly Iranians in Iran (n = 298). A Swedish control group (n = 151) was also randomly selected from the general population. Multiple linear regression procedures were applied to analyze data while adjusting for age, which was categorized into 60--69, and 70--84 years, and education. Iranian women in Sweden with shorter times of residence scored lower on vitality ({$\beta$}-coefficient = -7.9, 95\% CI = -14.3 to -1.5) compared with other women in this study. The lower vitality dimension score remained nearly unchanged in the main model ({$\beta$}-coefficient = -7.3, 95\% CI = -13.7 to -0.9). A longer period of residence in Sweden had a positive association with social functioning ({$\beta$}-coefficient = 14.1, 95\% CI = 3.1--25.1) and role limitation due to emotional problems ({$\beta$}-coefficient = 18.3, 95\% CI = 1.4--35.2) among elderly Iranian women. In general, the Swedish subsample scores higher on all dimensions of the SF-36 among women and in six out of eight among men in relation to the rest of the subsamples. The HRQL of elderly Iranians in Sweden was more like that of their countrymen in Iran than that of Swedes, who reported a better HRQL than Iranians in this study. However, length of time since migration to Sweden is not associated with poorer HRQL among elderly Iranians. The association varied, however, with sex. Elderly Iranian women showed an increase in two of eight dimensions of the SF-36 with additional years in Sweden, whereas, among elderly Iranian men, additional years in Sweden were not associated with HRQL.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health concern, with extensive associated health and economic implications. Actions to slow and contain the development of resistance are imperative. Despite the fact that overuse and misuse of antibiotics are highlighted as major contributing factors to this resistance, no sufficiently validated measures aiming to investigate the drivers behind consumer behaviour amongst the general population are available. The objective of this study was to develop and investigate the psychometric properties of an original, novel and multiple-item questionnaire, informed by the Theory of Planned Behaviour, to measure factors contributing to self-reported antibiotic use within the community. METHOD: A three-phase process was employed, including literature review and item generation; expert panel review; and pre-test. Investigation of the questionnaire was subsequently conducted through a cross-sectional, anonymous survey. Orthogonal principal analysis with varimax rotation, cronbach alpha and linear mixed-effects modelling analyses were conducted. A 60 item questionnaire was produced encompassing demographics, social desirability, three constructs of the Theory of Planned Behaviour including: attitudes and beliefs; subjective norm; perceived behavioural control; behaviour; and a covariate - knowledge. RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-three participants completed the survey. Eighty participants (21\%) were excluded due to social desirability concerns, with data from the remaining 293 participants analysed. Results showed modest but acceptable levels of internal reliability, with high inter-item correlations within each construct. All four variables and the outcome variable of antibiotic use behaviour comprised four items with the exception of social norms, for which there were two items, producing a final 18 item questionnaire. Perceived behavioural control, social norms, the interaction between attitudes and beliefs and knowledge, and the presence of a healthcare worker in the family were all significant predictors of antibiotic use behaviour. All other predictors tested produced a nonsignificant relationship with the outcome variable of self-reported antibiotic use. CONCLUSION: This study successfully developed and validated a novel tool which assesses factors influencing community antibiotic use and misuse. The questionnaire can be used to guide appropriate intervention strategies to reduce antibiotic misuse in the general population. Future research is required to assess the extent to which this tool can guide community-based intervention strategies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of health care-associated infection (HAI) in older people in acute care hospitals, detailing the specific types of HAI and specialties in which these are most prevalent. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the Scottish National Healthcare Associated Infection Prevalence Survey data set. PATIENTS AND SETTING: All inpatients in acute care (n = 11,090) in all acute care hospitals in Scotland (n = 45). RESULTS: The study found a linear relationship between prevalence of HAI and increasing age (P{$<$}.0001) in hospital inpatients in Scotland. Urinary tract infections and gastrointestinal infections represented the largest burden of HAI in the 75-84- and over-85-year age groups, and surgical-site infections represented the largest burden in inpatients under 75 years of age. The prevalence of urinary catheterization was higher in each of the over-65 age groups (P{$<$}.0001). Importantly, this study reveals that a high prevalence of HAI in inpatients over the age of 65 years is found across a range of specialties within acute hospital care. An increased prevalence of HAI was observed in medical, orthopedic, and surgical specialties. CONCLUSIONS: HAI is an important outcome indicator of acute inpatient hospital care, and our analysis demonstrates that HAI prevalence increases linearly with increasing age (P{$<$}.0001). Focusing interventions on preventing urinary tract infection and gastrointestinal infections would have the biggest public health benefit. To ensure patient safety, the importance of age as a risk factor for HAI cannot be overemphasized to those working in all areas of acute care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Readmission and mortality after hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and heart failure (HF) are publically reported. This systematic review assessed the impact of social factors on risk of readmission or mortality after hospitalization for CAP and HF---variables outside a hospital's control. METHODS: We searched OVID, PubMed and PSYCHINFO for studies from 1980 to 2012. Eligible articles examined the association between social factors and readmission or mortality in patients hospitalized with CAP or HF. We abstracted data on study characteristics, domains of social factors examined, and presence and magnitude of associations. RESULTS: Seventy-two articles met inclusion criteria (20 CAP, 52 HF). Most CAP studies evaluated age, gender, and race and found older age and non-White race were associated with worse outcomes. The results for gender were mixed. Few studies assessed higher level social factors, but those examined were often, but inconsistently, significantly associated with readmissions after CAP, including lower education, low income, and unemployment, and with mortality after CAP, including low income. For HF, older age was associated with worse outcomes and results for gender were mixed. Non-Whites had more readmissions after HF but decreased mortality. Again, higher level social factors were less frequently studied, but those examined were often, but inconsistently, significantly associated with readmissions, including low socioeconomic status (Medicaid insurance, low income), living situation (home stability rural address), lack of social support, being unmarried and risk behaviors (smoking, cocaine use and medical/visit non-adherence). Similar findings were observed for factors associated with mortality after HF, along with psychiatric comorbidities, lack of home resources and greater distance to hospital. CONCLUSIONS: A broad range of social factors affect the risk of post-discharge readmission and mortality in CAP and HF. Future research on adverse events after discharge should study social determinants of health.},

  abstract = {Introduction: the ACMEplus project aims to devise a standardised system for measuring case-mix and outcome in older patients admitted to hospitals in different parts of Europe for primarily `medical' (i.e. not surgical or psychiatric) reasons. As a first step in this project, a systematic review was carried out to identify factors which had a significant influence on outcome in such patients.Methods: the systematic search used Medline 1966--2000, Cinahl 1982--2000, Web of Science 1981--2000, reference lists of relevant papers and a hand search of Age and Ageing 1974--2000. A six-category grading system was devised to classify the 313 identified papers with regard to their relevance to the ACMEplus project, study design and power. The analysis of the 14 `category 1' papers is presented.Results: the main areas of assessment of case-mix were function, cognition, depression, illness severity, nutrition, social elements, aspects of diagnosis and demographic details. Statistically significant predictors, for the four outcome measures, listed below were:For length of stay: functional status score, illness severity, cognitive score, poor nutrition, comorbidity score, diagnosis or presenting illness, polypharmacy, age and gender.For mortality: functional status score, illness severity, cognitive score, comorbidity score, diagnosis or presenting illness, polypharmacy, age and gender.For discharge destination: functional status score, cognitive score, diagnosis or presenting illness and age.For readmission rate: functional status score, illness severity, co-morbidity, polypharmacy, diagnosis or presenting illness and age.Conclusions: factors affecting outcome in older medical patients are complex. When looking at outcomes of hospital admission in older people it is important not just to look at routinely available statistics such as age, gender and diagnosis but also to take into account multifaceted aspects such as functional status and cognitive function.},

  abstract = {Substantial research has documented pervasive disparities in the prevalence, severity, and morbidity of asthma among minority populations compared with non-Latino white subjects. The underlying causes of these disparities are not well understood, and as a result, the leverage points to address them remain unclear. A multilevel framework for integrating research in asthma health disparities is proposed to advance both future research and clinical practice. The components of the proposed model include health care policies and regulations, operation of the health care system, provider/clinician-level factors, social/environmental factors, and individual/family attitudes and behaviors. The body of research suggests that asthma disparities have multiple, complex, and interrelated sources. Disparities occur when individual, environmental, health system, and provider factors interact with one another over time. Given that the causes of asthma disparities are complex and multilevel, clinical strategies to address these disparities must therefore be comparably multilevel and target many aspects of asthma care. Several strategies that could be applied in clinical settings to reduce asthma disparities are described, including the need for routine assessment of the patient's beliefs, financial barriers to disease management, and health literacy and the provision of cultural competence training and communication skills to health care provider groups.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) in older people has been identified as a substantial problem, but few large population-based studies have investigated the underlying factors that predict it. OBJECTIVE: To: (i) examine trends in PIP in UK older primary care patients; and (ii) assess factors associated with PIP. METHODS: An analysis of routine, anonymized, computerized patient records of 201 UK general practices providing data to the DIN-LINK database between 1996 and 2005, which included approximately 230 000 registered patients per year aged {$>$} or = 65 years. The main outcome measures were the number of different drugs prescribed per patient annually and the percentage of patients prescribed a PIP drug (modified 2003 Beers criteria). These were assessed for all drugs, and then for selected sub-classes (analgesics, antidepressants and sedatives/anxiolytics). RESULTS: Whilst the number of drugs prescribed per patient increased, the percentage of subjects receiving a PIP drug declined from 32.2\% in 1996 to 28.3\% in 2005, largely due to a fall in co-proxamol (dextropropoxyphene/paracetamol [acetaminophen]) prescribing. In 2005, female gender, being older, more socio-economically deprived or in a care home were strongly associated with PIP. However, the number of drugs prescribed was strongly associated with these variables and the strongest predictor of PIP; adjusting for number of drugs dramatically reduced the strength of all other associations except female gender with PIP. Factors predicting PIP in drug sub-groups were similarly reduced when adjusted for polypharmacy. However, some age trends remained: in the oldest group (aged {$>$} or = 85 years), PIP of analgesics was less likely (odds ratio [OR] = 0.70, 95\% CI 0.66, 0.75) while PIP of antidepressants was more likely (OR = 1.39, 95\% CI 1.28, 1.51). CONCLUSION: PIP amongst older people in the UK, although declining, remains at a high level. The association of PIP with age, deprivation and care homes is largely explained by the higher overall prescribing rates in these groups. The overall rise in prescribing emphasizes that polypharmacy does not necessarily increase PIP and attempts to reduce PIP by focusing on polypharmacy have not been successful. Reductions in PIP have previously been achieved by introducing national guidelines (e.g. co-proxamol), but might also be achieved by alerting practitioners at the point of prescribing.},

Therefore, our aim was to analyse incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes across all occupational groups in Sweden.                                         Methods                                This nationwide study included all Swedish citizens born between 1937 and 1979 and gainfully employed between 2001 and 2013 (                 N                 \,=\,4,550,892), and followed for a diagnosis of diabetes from 2006 to 2015 (                 n                 \,=\,201,717) through national registers. Prevalence in 2013 (mean age 51~years; range 35--67) and age-standardised incidence (per 1000 person-years) were analysed across the 30 most common occupations among men and women. Information on BMI, physical fitness and smoking was obtained through the National Conscription (mean age 18) and Medical Birth Registers (mean age 29).                                                        Results               Prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 5.2\% in men and 3.2\% in women; in men it was highest among motor vehicle drivers (8.8\%) and in women it was highest among manufacturing workers (6.4\%). Incidence varied dramatically across occupational groups. In men, it was highest among manufacturing workers (9.41) and professional drivers (9.32) and lowest among university teachers (3.44). In women, incidence was highest in manufacturing workers (7.20) and cleaners (6.18) and lowest in physiotherapists (2.20). We found major differences in the prevalence of being overweight and smoking and in the level of physical fitness across these occupational groups even at young ages.                                         Conclusions/interpretation               Professional drivers, manufacturing workers and cleaners have a threefold increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared with university teachers and physiotherapists. These differences most likely reflect dramatic differences in the prevalence of lifestyle risk factors. If workplace interventions could reduce weight and increase physical activity among employees in these occupations, major health gains may be made.},

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to describe antibiotic  prescribing practices in three neonatology units in Kigali, Rwanda. METHODS: A  multi-center, cross-sectional study conducted in two tertiary and one urban  district hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. Participants were neonates admitted in  neonatology who received a course of antibiotics during their admission. Data  collected included risk factors for neonatal sepsis, clinical signs, symptoms,  investigations for neonatal sepsis, antibiotics prescribed, and the number of  deaths in the included cohort. RESULTS: 126 neonates were enrolled with 42 from  each site. Prematurity (38\%) followed by membrane rupture more than 18 hours  (25\%) were the main risk factors for neonatal sepsis. Ampicillin and Gentamicin  (85\%) were the most commonly used first-line antibiotics for suspected neonatal  sepsis. Most neonates (87\%) did not receive a second-line antibiotic. Cefotaxime  (11\%), was the most commonly used second-line antibiotic. The median duration of  antibiotic use was four days in all surviving neonates (m=113). In neonates with  negative blood culture and normal C-reactive protein (CRP), the median duration  of antibiotics was 3.5 days; and for neonates, with positive blood cultures, the  median duration was 11 days. Thirteen infants died (10\%) at all three sites, with  no significant difference between the sites. CONCLUSION: The median antibiotic  duration for neonates with normal lab results exceeded the recommended duration  mandated by the national neonatal protocol. We recommend the development of  antibiotic stewardship programs in neonatal units in Rwanda to prevent the  adverse effects which may be caused by inappropriate or excessive use of  antibiotics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria are threatening modern health care. However, estimating their incidence, complications, and attributable mortality is challenging. We aimed to estimate the burden of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria of public health concern in countries of the EU and European Economic Area (EEA) in 2015, measured in number of cases, attributable deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). METHODS: We estimated the incidence of infections with 16 antibiotic resistance-bacterium combinations from European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) 2015 data that was country-corrected for population coverage. We multiplied the number of bloodstream infections (BSIs) by a conversion factor derived from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control point prevalence survey of health-care-associated infections in European acute care hospitals in 2011-12 to estimate the number of non-BSIs. We developed disease outcome models for five types of infection on the basis of systematic reviews of the literature. FINDINGS: From EARS-Net data collected between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2015, we estimated 671 689 (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 583 148-763 966) infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, of which 63.5\% (426 277 of 671 689) were associated with health care. These infections accounted for an estimated 33 110 (28 480-38 430) attributable deaths and 874 541 (768 837-989 068) DALYs. The burden for the EU and EEA was highest in infants (aged {$<$}1 year) and people aged 65 years or older, had increased since 2007, and was highest in Italy and Greece. INTERPRETATION: Our results present the health burden of five types of infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria expressed, for the first time, in DALYs. The estimated burden of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU and EEA is substantial compared with that of other infectious diseases, and has increased since 2007. Our burden estimates provide useful information for public health decision-makers prioritising interventions for infectious diseases. FUNDING: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.},

The education programs of the Working Group of Regional Cooperative Rheumatism Centers in the German Society for Rheumatology (AGRZ), such as StruPI, the offers of the German Rheumatism League (Deutsche Rheuma-Liga) and other elements provide a framework for those affected and their relatives, in which a participative decision-making (PEF) on equal terms can be possible. The physician-patient communication changes in the sense of a PEF and hopefully leads to a sustainably better patient compliance. Non-medicinal treatment, comorbidities and changes in life style are important issues in such cases. The StruPI is an established format for information and education of patients, particularly in outpatient rheumatism patients. In the midterm patient education (outpatient and inpatient) and self-management courses will be offered and honored nationwide, analogue to other chronic diseases, e.g. asthma and diabetes. Patients can influence the course of the disease by life style changes. The treatment of chronic diseases can only function in the long term in a consensual partnership.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the effect of health literacy on agreement for bariatric surgery among morbidly obese patients. METHODS: The data of 242 morbidly obese patients (body mass index-BMI {$\geq~$}40~kg/m(2)) were evaluated in a cross-sectional case-control pattern. The patients were classified into two groups as those who were attending the clinic for the purpose of receiving bariatric surgery (n~=~138) and those who did not (n~=~104). The Turkish version of the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q47), consisting of 47 questions, was used for the health literacy evaluation. RESULTS: It was seen that patients who accepted bariatric surgery were younger and had higher weight and BMI values (p~{$<~$}0.001). HLS-EU-Q47 index results were 33.33 (15.63-50) in the group who agreed to bariatric surgery and 26.04 (8.33:46.88) in the group who did not agree to bariatric surgery, and a statistically significant difference was determined between the two groups (p~{$<~$}0.001). From the HLS-EU-Q47 questionnaire, an insufficient level (0-25) was found for 2.9\% of the group who agreed to bariatric surgery and 45.2\% of the group who did not (p~{$<~$}0.001). The problematic-limited level was similar in the two groups ({$>~$}25-33) (respectively, 36.2\%, 37.5\%, p~=~0.840). A sufficient level ({$>~$}33-42) and a perfect level were higher in the group who agreed to bariatric surgery (respectively, 42.8\%, 18.1\%, p~{$<~$}0.001). CONCLUSION: There is a relationship between health literacy and acceptance of bariatric surgery in morbidly obese patients. The higher the health literacy level, the more the agreement to bariatric surgery increased.},

Aim of the study is to explore whether a physical activity (PA) intervention can reduce prevalence and severity of frailty in a community-dwelling elders at risk of disability. METHODS: Exploratory analyses from the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders pilot, a randomized controlled trial enrolling 424 community-dwelling persons (mean age=76.8 years) with sedentary lifestyle and at risk of mobility disability. Participants were randomized to a 12-month PA intervention versus a successful aging education group. The frailty phenotype (ie, {$>$}/=3 of the following defining criteria: involuntary weight loss, exhaustion, sedentary behavior, slow gait speed, poor handgrip strength) was measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Repeated measures generalized linear models were conducted. RESULTS: A significant (p = .01) difference in frailty prevalence was observed at 12 months in the PA intervention group (10.0\%; 95\% confidence interval = 6.5\%, 15.1\%), relative to the successful aging group (19.1\%; 95\% confidence interval = 13.9\%,15.6\%). Over follow-up, in comparison to successful aging participants, the mean number of frailty criteria in the PA group was notably reduced for younger subjects, blacks, participants with frailty, and those with multimorbidity. Among the frailty criteria, the sedentary behavior was the one most affected by the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Regular PA may reduce frailty, especially in individuals at higher risk of disability. Future studies should be aimed at testing the possible benefits produced by multidomain interventions on frailty.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Rising antibiotic resistance may negatively affect the health and cost of care for patients. This study aimed to determine the impact of antibiotic resistance on costs and health consequences for patients. METHODOLOGY: A one-year observational study was conducted at Christian Medical College, Vellore, a tertiary care hospital, on patients admitted into medical wards with a preliminary diagnosis of suspected sepsis. Patients with confirmed bacteremia were analysed in two groups - resistant and susceptible - based on susceptibility of causative bacteria to the empiric antibiotics administered. Clinical data and details about costs incurred were collected from hospital records. Costs and health consequences were compared using Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test. For median difference in costs, 95\% bootstrap confidence interval was determined. RESULTS: Overall, 220 patients were included. The median difference between resistant and susceptible groups in overall costs, antibiotic costs, and pharmacy costs was rupees (INR)/USD 41,993/700 (p = 0.001), 8,315/139 (p {$<$} 0.001) and 21,492/358 (p {$<$} 0.001), respectively. Health consequences such as intensive care admissions, complications, mortality, and length of stay were significantly higher in the resistant group as compared to susceptible group: 44\% vs. 21\% (p {$<$} 0.001), 56\% vs. 37\% (p = 0.006), 12\% vs. 2\% (p = 0.011), and 14 vs. 11 days (p = 0{$\cdot$}027), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic resistance has a significant impact on cost and health consequences. These findings provide a key message for policymakers and other stakeholders to initiate feasible strategies to tackle resistance and reduce the burden.},

This study aimed to examine the association between polypharmacy and the risk of hospitalization and mortality. We included 3,007,620 elderly individuals aged\,{$\geq$}\,65~years who had at least one routinely-prescribed medication but had no prior hospitalization within a year. The primary exposures of interest were number of daily prescribed medications (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, and\,{$\geq$}\,11) and presence of polypharmacy ({$\geq$}\,5 prescription drugs per day). The corresponding comparators were the lowest number of medications (1-2) and absence of polypharmacy. The study outcomes were hospitalization and all-cause death. The median age of participants was 72~years and 39.5\% were men. Approximately, 46.6\% of participants experienced polypharmacy. Over a median follow-up of 5.0~years, 2,028,062 (67.4\%) hospitalizations and 459,076 (15.3\%) all-cause deaths were observed. An incrementally higher number of daily prescribed medications was found to be associated with increasingly higher risk for hospitalization and mortality. These associations were consistent across subgroups of age, sex, residential area, and comorbidities. Furthermore, polypharmacy was associated with greater risk of hospitalization and death: adjusted HRs (95\% CIs) were 1.18 (1.18-1.19) and 1.25 (1.24-1.25) in the overall and 1.16 (1.16-1.17) and 1.25 (1.24-1.25) in the matched cohorts, respectively. Hence, polypharmacy was associated with a higher risk of hospitalization and all-cause death among elderly individuals.},

  abstract = {Ageing is associated with a reduction in appetite and food intake, which has been termed the 'anorexia of ageing'. After age 70-75 years average body weight decreases, even in healthy people, disproportionately due to loss of lean tissue. The 'physiological' anorexia and weight loss of ageing predispose to pathological weight loss and malnutrition. Marked weight loss is common in the elderly and a major cause of morbidity and increased mortality. The cause(s) of the anorexia of ageing are largely unknown. We have identified several possibilities. Animal and preliminary human studies indicate that ageing is associated with increased satiety factors and a reduced feeding drive. Endogenous opioids stimulate eating. We administered i.v. infusions of the opioid antagonist naloxone to young and older adults. Overall, the suppression of food intake was not different in the two age groups, but was increased in older women, suggesting reduced stimulation of feeding by endogenous opioids in this group. Plasma concentrations of the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) increase with ageing. Intravenous CCK-8 infusion produced greater suppression of food intake in older than young subjects (33.5 vs 15.5\% P = 0.026), indicating that sensitivity to the satiating effects of CCK is at least maintained and may increase with age. This raises the possibility of using CCK antagonists as stimulants of appetite and food intake in malnourished older people.},

Among the 100 unplanned readmissions, 13\% were assessed as inappropriate, and 37\% as potentially avoidable. Given this high rate of potentially avoidable readmissions, there is a need to identify preventive interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infections are one of the leading causes of death in the neonatal period. This trial aims to evaluate if the provision of alcohol-based hand rub  (ABHR) to pregnant women for postnatal household use prevents severe infections  (including sepsis, diarrhoea, pneumonia, or death) among infants during the first  three postnatal months. METHODS: Through a cluster-randomised trial in eastern  Uganda, 72 clusters are randomised in a 2-arm design with rural villages as units  of randomisation. We estimate to include a total of 5932 pregnant women at 34  weeks of gestation. All women and infants in the study are receiving standard  antenatal and postnatal care. Women in the intervention group additionally  receive six litres of ABHR and training on its use. Research midwives conduct  follow-up visits at participants' homes on days 1, 7, 28, 42, and 90 after birth  and telephone calls on days 14, 48, and 60 to assess the mother and infant for  study outcomes. Primary analyses will be by intention to treat. DISCUSSION: This  study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of a locally available and  low-cost intervention in preventing neonatal sepsis and early infant infections.  If ABHR is found effective, it could be implemented by adding it to birthing  kits. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Pan African Clinical Trial Registry,  PACTR202004705649428.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in two nephrology departments from two hospitals in Guangzhou, China (n\,=\,226). The HL questionnaire, PBFR Subscale of Health Belief Model Constructs and Fluid Adherence Subscale of the HD Patients Therapy Adherence Scale were used. R-IDWG was calculated by the mean IDWG (from 3 consecutive HD), divided by the dry weight. RESULTS: In structural equation modeling, three domains of the HL questionnaire, namely Actively Managing My Health, Social Support and Actively Engaging with Healthcare Providers (HCPs), were directly and positively associated with PBFR. Higher Actively Managing My Health predicted higher SRFR both directly and indirectly. Sufficient Social Support and adequate Actively Engaging with HCPs predicted higher SRFR indirectly. All three HL domains predicted R-IDWG indirectly. CONCLUSION: Improving patients' HL could increase their understanding of PBFR and be more apt to follow fluid restrictions and reduce R-IDWG. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: A better understanding of the relationships among HL, PBFR, SRFR and R-IDWG will allow for tailored interventions to decrease R-IDWG in people receiving HD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUNDS: Lower health literacy (HL) is associated with several cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome (MS). The aim of our study was to investigate the association between HL and the Framingham 10-year risk score of CVD. METHODS: From 2015-2016, 1010 subjects aged 23 to 88 years receiving health check-up in Taipei Veterans General Hospital had complete clinical evaluations and laboratory examinations. Fatty liver was diagnosed by ultrasonography. The short form questionnaire adapted from the Mandarin Health Literacy Scale was used to assess HL. The Framingham risk score was calculated by patient characteristics. RESULTS: Subjects with higher BMIs were associated with lower HL scores. The proportion of subjects with MS was higher in the lower health literacy score group ({$\leq$} 9) at 28.8\%; further analysis found that lower HL was significantly associated with MS in women but not in men. The Spearman's rho demonstrated that the HL score was significantly associated with the BMI-based (rho = -0.11; P {$<$} 0.001) or lipid-based (rho = -0.09; P {$<$} 0.004) Framingham risk score. CONCLUSIONS: Higher HL scores were associated with less CVD risk such as lower BMIs, less MS in women, and less fatty liver disease. Furthermore, HL had an inverse association with the Framingham risk score as expected. Therefore, HL in patients with CVD risk should be improved and considered as an important issue in terms of CVD reduction.},

  abstract = {Polypharmacy is a major concern in the care of older adults. People over 65 years of age frequently have multiple medical conditions and may have cancer, which requires multiple medications for treatment. The use of multiple medications increases the risk of drug-drug interactions, non-adherence, and adverse drug reactions. Polypharmacy is a term that refers to a high number of prescribed medications, usually five and above, or the use of more medications than is clinically justified. Although medications are an important factor in improving and maintaining the quality of life of older adults, polypharmacy increases the risks of morbidity and mortality, loss of functional independence, and a multiplicity of cognitive and physical problems in this population. This article examines issues related to polypharmacy in older adults and identifies nursing strategies and interventions to detect and prevent polypharmacy. Nursing strategies discussed include: (1) increasing patient knowledge of pharmacological issues, (2) increasing patient medication management competency, (3) promoting safe patient medication practices, and (4) enhancing patient education. Nurses must be familiar with medicine regimens, understand the primary factors that affect adherence, and participate in continuing education to enhance their ability to safeguard older adult patients.},

The lack of access to diagnostic testing and excessively long  turnaround times to result contributes to delays in sepsis identification and  initiation of appropriate treatment. This study aims to evaluate the novel  InTrays COLOREX Screen and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase for rapid  identification of bacterial pathogens causing sepsis and detection of resistance.  METHODS: Neonates with suspected sepsis admitted to the Harare Central Hospital  were prospectively enrolled. One blood culture was collected and incubated using  the BacT/ALERT automated system. Positive blood cultures with potential pathogens  identified by Gram stain were inoculated on the InTray COLOREX Screen and  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase culture plates. RESULTS: A total of 216 neonates  with suspected sepsis were recruited. Pathogens were isolated from blood cultures  in 56 (25.9\%) neonates of which 54 were Klebsiella pneumoniae. All K. pneumoniae  were resistant to ceftriaxone and 53 (98\%) were resistant to gentamicin.  Sensitivity and specificity for ceftriaxone-resistant K. pneumoniae detection  using InTrays were 100\%. InTrays results were interpretable as early as 5-10  hours (median 7 hours, interquartile range 7-7) post blood culture positivity  enabling rapid identification and notification of result and leading to a 60\%  reduction in time to result from blood culture collection. CONCLUSIONS: This  study shows that the implementation of a novel culture method was feasible and  reduced turnaround times for results by 60\% compared with standard microbiologic  techniques. An impact on patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness of this method  needs to be demonstrated.},

With a sample of 489 elderly Medicare patients in a Midwestern city in the USA, we explored the intermediate factors that may link health literacy to health status and utilization of health services such as hospitalization and emergency care. We expected to find that individuals with higher health literacy would have better health status and less frequent use of emergency room and hospital services due to (1) greater disease knowledge, (2) healthier behaviors, (3) greater use of preventive care, and (4) a higher degree of compliance with medication. Using path analysis, we found, however, that health literacy had direct effects on health outcomes and that none of these variables of interest was a significant intermediate factor through which health literacy affected use of hospital services. Our findings suggest that improving health literacy may be an effective strategy to improve health status and to reduce the use of expensive hospital and emergency room services among elderly patients.},

Like its predecessors, the purpose is to provide an evidence-based approach to the prevention and management of hypertension. The key messages of this report are these: in those older than age 50, systolic blood pressure (BP) of greater than 140 mm Hg is a more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP; beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, CVD risk doubles for each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; those who are normotensive at 55 years of age will have a 90\% lifetime risk of developing hypertension; prehypertensive individuals (systolic BP 120--139 mm Hg or diastolic BP 80--89 mm Hg) require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent the progressive rise in blood pressure and CVD; for uncomplicated hypertension, thiazide diuretic should be used in drug treatment for most, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes; this report delineates specific high-risk conditions that are compelling indications for the use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); two or more antihypertensive medications will be required to achieve goal BP ({$<$}140/90 mm Hg, or {$<$}130/80 mm Hg) for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease; for patients whose BP is more than 20 mm Hg above the systolic BP goal or more than 10 mm Hg above the diastolic BP goal, initiation of therapy using two agents, one of which usually will be a thiazide diuretic, should be considered; regardless of therapy or care, hypertension will be controlled only if patients are motivated to stay on their treatment plan. Positive experiences, trust in the clinician, and empathy improve patient motivation and satisfaction. This report serves as a guide, and the committee continues to recognize that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.},

The study included participants examined between January 1, 1986, and December 31, 2018, whose both parents had their BMI measurement taken at their own prerecruitment evaluation in the past. Data analysis was performed from May to December 2023.Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for offsprings' BMI and their mothers', fathers', and midparental BMI percentile (the mean of the mothers' and fathers' BMI cohort- and sex-specific BMI percentile) to estimate heritability. Logistic regression models were applied to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% CIs of obesity compared with healthy BMI, according to parental BMI status.A total of 447\,883 offspring (235\,105 male [52.5\%]; mean [SD] age, 17.09 [0.34] years) with both parents enrolled and measured for BMI at 17 years of age were enrolled in the study, yielding a total study population of 1\,343\,649 individuals. Overall, the correlation between midparental BMI percentile at 17 years of age and the offspring's BMI at 17 years of age was moderate ({$\rho$}\,=\,0.386). Among female offspring, maternal-offspring BMI correlation ({$\rho$}\,=\,0.329) was somewhat higher than the paternal-offspring BMI correlation ({$\rho$}\,=\,0.266). Among trios in which both parents had a healthy BMI, the prevalence of overweight or obesity in offspring was 15.4\%; this proportion increased to 76.6\% when both parents had obesity and decreased to 3.3\% when both parents had severe underweight. Compared with healthy weight, maternal (OR, 4.96; 95\% CI, 4.63-5.32), paternal (OR, 4.48; 95\% CI, 4.26-4.72), and parental (OR, 6.44; 95\% CI, 6.22-6.67) obesity (midparent BMI in the {$\geq$}95th percentile) at 17 years of age were associated with increased odds of obesity among offspring.In this cohort study of military enrollees whose parents also underwent prerecruitment evaluations, the observed correlation between midparental and offspring BMI, coupled with a calculated narrow-sense heritability of 39\%, suggested a substantive contribution of genetic factors to BMI variation at 17 years of age.},

CONTENT: This is a systematic qualitative review following the MOOSE guidelines. A systematic, computer-assisted literature search via PubMed scientific database, between January 1st, 2000, and September 30th 2020, was conducted. Only cross-sectional epidemiologic research studies that were published in the English language, investigating HL's possible role as a determinant of childhood and adult obesity, were included. SUMMARY: After screening 725 citations from the PubMed database, 39 (n=39) studies in total were included in this literature review; Four (n=4) studies were conducted in the children population, seven (n=7) studies were performed in children-parent/caregiver dyads, and 28 studies (n=28) enrolled adults. There is significant evidence that HL knowledge and skills determine the consequent management of obesity and BMI rates in children and adult populations. OUTLOOK: Despite policies and action plans put in place by countries globally, overweight and obesity continue to be a pressing public health issue and one of the critical drivers of non-communicable diseases, constituting a health, social and economic burden worldwide. Health Literacy as an essential health policy and promotion agenda item and a critical empowerment strategy could increase children's and adults' control over their overall health and awareness to overcome obesity issues. Initiatives to improve HL levels could be useful tools in managing the obesity epidemic, starting from integrating HL in the school curriculum and further in family and community action plans.},

Seventy-six familial caregivers were asked to complete the Caregiver Burden Inventory-CBI, Caregiver Needs Assessment-CNA, and Health Literacy Questionnaire-HLQ, before and after the course. A significant decrease in CBI and an increase of CNA were observed. However, a significantly higher rate of CBI decrease and a lower increase of CNA were detected in the neurological compared to the oncological group (p\,=\,0.001). Moreover, the ability of the participants to look for and find health information significantly improved. The course contrasted caregivers' burden, increased their search for health information, and revealed their requiring of training and emotional and social support. Caregiver education plays a pivotal role in the management of chronic patients, enhancing the quality of life of both patients and caregivers.},

Furthermore, the early readmission rate is often used as an indicator of the quality of care. We performed a systematic review of the literature to better understand the risk factors of early readmission (30 and 90 days) in the geriatric population and to update the existing evidence on this subject. The search was carried out on the MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases. Three independent reviewers assessed the potential inclusion of the studies, and then each study was independently assessed by two reviewers using Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools; any discrepancies were resolved by the third reviewer. Studies that included inpatients in surgical wards were excluded. Twenty-nine studies were included in the review. Risk factors of early readmission can be classified into socio-economic factors, factors relating to the patient's health characteristics, factors related to the use of the healthcare system and clinical factors. Among these risk factors, those linked to patient frailty play an important role, in particular malnutrition, reduced mobility, risk of falls, fatigue and functional dependence. The early identification of patients at higher risk of early readmission may allow for targeted interventions in view of discharge.},

  abstract = {Importance               The childhood obesity epidemic is presumed to drive pediatric type 2 diabetes (T2D); however, the global scale of obesity in children with T2D is unknown.                                         Objectives               To evaluate the global prevalence of obesity in pediatric T2D, examine the association of sex and race with obesity risk, and assess the association of obesity with glycemic control and dyslipidemia.                                         Data Sources               MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched from database inception to June 16, 2022.                                         Study Selection               Observational studies with at least 10 participants reporting the prevalence of obesity in patients with pediatric T2D were included.                                         Data Extraction and Synthesis               Following the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline, 2 independent reviewers in teams performed data extraction and risk of bias and level of evidence analyses. The meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model.                                         Main Outcomes and Measures               The primary outcomes included the pooled prevalence rates of obesity in children with T2D. The secondary outcomes assessed pooled prevalence rates by sex and race and associations between obesity and glycemic control and dyslipidemia.                                         Results               Of 57 articles included in the systematic review, 53 articles, with 8942 participants, were included in the meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of obesity among pediatric patients with T2D was 75.27\% (95\% CI, 70.47\%-79.78\%), and the prevalence of obesity at diabetes diagnosis among 4688 participants was 77.24\% (95\% CI, 70.55\%-83.34\%). While male participants had higher odds of obesity than female participants (odds ratio, 2.10; 95\% CI, 1.33-3.31), Asian participants had the lowest prevalence of obesity (64.50\%; 95\% CI, 53.28\%-74.99\%), and White participants had the highest prevalence of obesity (89.86\%; 95\% CI, 71.50\%-99.74\%) compared with other racial groups. High heterogeneity across studies and varying degrees of glycemic control and dyslipidemia were noted.                                         Conclusions and Relevance               The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that obesity is not a universal phenotype in children with T2D. Further studies are needed to consider the role of obesity and other mechanisms in diabetes genesis in this population.},

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a stratified random sample of case notes of patients with an unplanned readmission between July 1987 and June 1988 by nine clinical assessors (263 assessments) and categorisation of the readmission as avoidable, unavoidable, or unclassifiable. SETTING: District in North East Thames region. 481 General medical, geriatric, and general surgical inpatients with a readmission at 0-6 days or 21-27 days after the first (index) discharge between July 1987 and June 1988 from whom 100 case notes were selected randomly and of which 74 were available for study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessment of readmissions as avoidable, unavoidable, unclassifiable, variability of assessment within cases and variability among assessors according to specialty and duration to readmission. RESULTS: General medical and geriatric readmissions and surgical readmissions at 0-6 days after discharge were more likely to be assessed as avoidable than those at 21-27 days (medical readmissions 32 v 6\%, surgical admissions 49 v 19\%). General surgical readmissions were significantly more frequently assessed as avoidable than general medical and geriatric readmissions. The extent of agreement between doctors varied, with general medical and geriatric readmissions at 21-27 days after first discharge causing the greatest variability of judgment. CONCLUSIONS: Differences were apparent in the extent of avoidability of readmissions in different groups of admissions. However, assessors rated only 49.3\% of the group with the highest proportion of avoidable admissions (surgical readmissions at 0-6 days) as avoidable. The remainder were thought to be unavoidable except for 2\%, which could not be classified. The use of readmission rates as an outcome indicator of hospital inpatient care should be avoided.},

It is a state of vulnerability to poor resolution of homoeostasis after a stressor event and is a consequence of cumulative decline in many physiological systems during a lifetime. This cumulative decline depletes homoeostatic reserves until minor stressor events trigger disproportionate changes in health status. In landmark studies, investigators have developed valid models of frailty and these models have allowed epidemiological investigations that show the association between frailty and adverse health outcomes. We need to develop more efficient methods to detect frailty and measure its severity in routine clinical practice, especially methods that are useful for primary care. Such progress would greatly inform the appropriate selection of elderly people for invasive procedures or drug treatments and would be the basis for a shift in the care of frail elderly people towards more appropriate goal-directed care.},

Prospective studies assessing the DTA of simple instruments for identifying frailty in community-dwelling older people (aged {$\geq$}65 years) as index tests against a reference standard phenotype model, cumulative deficit frailty index or comprehensive geriatric assessment were eligible for inclusion. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and likelihood ratios were calculated for index tests. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2 checklist.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: three studies involving 3,261 participants were included. Median frailty prevalence was 10.5\%. Seven index tests were assessed: gait speed, timed-up-and-go test, PRISMA 7 questionnaire, self-reported health, general practitioner clinical assessment, polypharmacy and Groningen Frailty Index. For a gait speed of {$<$}0.8 m/s, the sensitivity = 0.99 and specificity = 0.64. For the PRISMA 7, the sensitivity = 0.83 and specificity = 0.83. For the timed get-up-and-go test of 10 s, the sensitivity = 0.93 and specificity = 0.62. DTA was notably lower for all other index tests. All three studies were judged at unclear risk of bias.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nDISCUSSION: slow gait speed, PRISMA 7 and the timed get-up-and-go test have high sensitivity for identifying frailty. However, limited specificity implies many false-positive results which means that these instruments cannot be used as accurate single tests to identify frailty.},

In recent years, health literacy has received increased attention as a factor that can help explain differences in health outcomes. However, examination of life course predictors of health literacy has been limited. METHODS: life course data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study 1957-2011 were used to examine predictors of health literacy in old age (N = 2,122), using the Newest Vital Sign. Generalised structural equation modelling was used to model pathways to health literacy. RESULTS: predictors of health literacy included educational attainment, and adolescent cognitive and non-cognitive skills, and, in men, rate of cognitive decline from middle to later life. DISCUSSION: numerous studies have documented health literacy issues among older adults, and recommendations have been made for ways to improve health literacy for this population. This study reports on risk factors across the life course that are associated with health literacy later in life, identifying possible intervention targets to reduce risk of poor health as people age.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To explore the association of self-rated health (SRH) with host resistance to illness after exposure to a common cold virus and identify mechanisms linking SRH to future health status. METHODS: We analyzed archival data from 360 healthy adults (mean [standard deviation] age = 33.07 [10.69] years, 45.6\% women). Each person completed validated questionnaires that assessed SRH (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor), socioemotional factors, and health practices and was subsequently exposed to a common cold virus and monitored for 5 days for clinical illness (infection and objective signs of illness). RESULTS: Poorer SRH was associated in a graded fashion with greater susceptibility to developing clinical illness (good/fair versus excellent: odds ratio = 3.21, 95\% confidence interval = 1.47-6.99; very good versus excellent: odds ratio = 2.60, 95\% confidence interval = 1.27-5.32), independent of age, sex, race, prechallenge immunity (specific antibody), body mass, season, education, and income. Greater illness risk was not attributable to infection, but to increased likelihood of developing objective signs of illness once infected. Poorer SRH also correlated with poorer health practices, increased stress, lower positive emotions, and other socioemotional factors. However, none of these (alone or together) accounted for the association between SRH and host resistance. Additional data (separate study) indicated that history of having colds was unrelated to susceptibility and hence also did not account for the SRH link with immunocompetence. CONCLUSIONS: Poorer SRH is associated with poorer immunocompetence, possibly reflecting sensitivity to sensations associated with premorbid immune dysfunction. In turn, poorer immune function may be a major contributing mechanism linking SRH to future health.},

A care transitions intervention designed to encourage patients and their caregivers to assert a more active role during care transitions may reduce rehospitalization rates. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial. Between September 1, 2002, and August 31, 2003, patients were identified at the time of hospitalization and were randomized to receive the intervention or usual care. The setting was a large integrated delivery system located in Colorado. Subjects (N = 750) included community-dwelling adults 65 years or older admitted to the study hospital with 1 of 11 selected conditions. Intervention patients received (1) tools to promote cross-site communication, (2) encouragement to take a more active role in their care and to assert their preferences, and (3) continuity across settings and guidance from a "transition coach." Rates of rehospitalization were measured at 30, 90, and 180 days. RESULTS: Intervention patients had lower rehospitalization rates at 30 days (8.3 vs 11.9, P = .048) and at 90 days (16.7 vs 22.5, P = .04) than control subjects. Intervention patients had lower rehospitalization rates for the same condition that precipitated the index hospitalization at 90 days (5.3 vs 9.8, P = .04) and at 180 days (8.6 vs 13.9, P = .046) than controls. The mean hospital costs were lower for intervention patients (\$2058) vs controls (\$2546) at 180 days (log-transformed P = .049). CONCLUSION: Coaching chronically ill older patients and their caregivers to ensure that their needs are met during care transitions may reduce the rates of subsequent rehospitalization.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Improving education about health literacy for health care professionals has been recommended, and many US family medicine residency programs have developed such curricula. Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of health literacy curricula for health care professionals. This pilot study aimed to determine whether a longitudinal health literacy curriculum for family medicine residents could achieve long-term sustained improvements in health literacy knowledge and clear communication practices. METHODS: Self-reported pre- and postassessments were conducted for a series of four health literacy didactic and experiential trainings over 11 months with a cohort of 12 first-year family medicine residents (study adequately powered for cohort of 10 or more). RESULTS: Five out of five health literacy knowledge items showed sustained significant improvement immediately after the initial didactic training. Two out of eight clear communication behaviors (eliciting patients' questions through an open-ended approach, and using a teach-back method to check for patients' understanding) showed sustained significant improvements in the 11-month follow-up period. The remaining six behaviors demonstrated a saw-tooth pattern, wherein each training session produced improvements in planned behaviors, which were, however, not maintained at subsequent follow-up assessments. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that residents learned the cognitive material related to health literacy and clear communication easily, but had difficulty integrating many trained skills into clinical practice, despite the use of experiential learning techniques. Future studies should use an observational design to assess clear communication behaviors, and should include assessment of potential barriers to implementing clear communication skills in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection (SSI) following joint arthroplasty increases length of stay, hospital cost, and leads to patient and healthcare provider dissatisfaction. Due to the presence of non-biologic implants (the prosthetic joint) in these procedures, infection is often devastating and treatment of the infection is more difficult. For this reason, prevention of SSI is of crucial importance in this population. Staphylococcus aureus colonizes the nares of approximately 30-40\% of the population, is the most common pathogen causing SSI, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rate. A pre-operative shower or bath with an antiseptic is an inexpensive and effective method of removal of these transient skin pathogens prior to the procedure and may be used to decrease SSI. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that a preoperative antiseptic shower or bath will decrease the rate of SSI. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed at two affiliated hospitals within the same system, one with a hospital-wide policy enforcing pre-operative antiseptic shower or bath and the other with no policy, with cases included from January 2010 to June 2012. International Classification of Disease-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes and chart review were used to identify patients undergoing joint arthroplasty and to identify those with SSI. RESULTS: Two thousand three-hundred forty-nine arthroplasties were performed at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, a tertiary-care hospital with a pre-operative antiseptic shower or bath policy in place. An additional 1,693 procedures were performed at Fairview Ridges Hospital, a community hospital with no pre-operative policy. There was no difference in the rate of SSI between the two hospitals (1.96\% vs. 1.95\%; p=1.0). However, the rate of SSI caused by S. aureus was significantly decreased by pre-operative antiseptic shower/bath (17\% vs. 61\%; p=0.03), as was the rate of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections (2\% vs. 24\% p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: A pre-operative antiseptic shower and bath policy was associated with a significant decrease in S. aureus and MRSA SSI, but did not decrease the total incidence of SSI. This intervention may decrease the morbidity of S. aureus SSI in this population.},

METHODS: A qualitative descriptive design was selected for this study. Older adults ({$\geq$}65) with chronic cardiac diagnoses were invited to participate. The investigator shadowed the physician during the patient encounter, interviewed the patients following their encounter, and asked patients to complete standard health literacy and cognitive screening tools and the Patient Activation Measure. Directed content analysis was used to analyze transcripts. RESULTS: Patients (n=40) found the clinical summary useful for sharing information with family members and other physicians, reminding and informing, and for engaging in behavior change. Seventy-six percent reported that they would not go online to access the clinical summary for multiple reasons, including not being "computer savvy" and privacy concerns. Participant recommendations for a re-designed, improved clinical summary are included. The clinical summary helps patients and families communicate among health care professionals in a complex, disjointed health care system that often burdens patients with that responsibility. The majority of participants were happy with the paper version and offered multiple reasons for not wanting online access that may help us to focus on more compelling reasons for patient portal use. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitatively, it appears that the clinical summary is a useful tool for engaging people with chronic disease in self-management. The participants in this study told us what many of us already know to be true; that the documentation we provide patients and families is less than ideal.},

DESIGN: Cluster randomized controlled trial. SETTING: RAC facilities with higher than expected hospitalizations in Auckland, New Zealand, were recruited and randomized to intervention or control. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1998 residents of 18 intervention facilities and 18 control facilities. INTERVENTION: A facility-based complex intervention of 9 months' duration. The intervention comprised gerontology nurse specialist (GNS)-led staff education, facility bench-marking, GNS resident review, and multidisciplinary (geriatrician, primary-care physician, pharmacist, GNS, and facility nurse) discussion of residents selected using standard criteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary end point was avoidable hospitalizations. Secondary end points were all acute admissions, mortality, and acute bed-days. Follow-up was for a total of 14 months. RESULTS: The intervention did not affect main study end points: number of acute avoidable hospital admissions (RR 1.07; 95\% CI 0.85-1.36; P = .59) or mortality (RR 1.11; 95\% CI 0.76-1.61; P = .62). CONCLUSIONS: This multidisciplinary intervention, packaging selected case review, and staff education had no overall impact on acute hospital admissions or mortality.

  abstract = {The data from nine centres in Europe which had used the Geriatric Mental Scale (GMS) AGECAT were analysed to compare prevalence of diagnoses in subjects aged 65 years and over living in the community. Levels of depressive illness were: Iceland 8.8\%, Liverpool 10.0\%; Zaragoza 10.7\%; Dublin 11.9\%; Amsterdam 12.0\%; Berlin 16.5\%; London 17.3\%; Verona 18.3\% and Munich 23.6\%. Taking all levels of depression, five high (Amsterdam, Berlin, Munich, London and Verona) and four low (Dublin, Iceland, Liverpool, Zaragoza) scoring centres were identified. Meta-analysis of all 13,808 subjects yielded a mean level of depression of 12.3\% (95\% CI 11.8-12.9), 14.1\% for women (95\% CI 13.5-14.8) and 8.6\% for men (95\% CI 7.9-9.3). Symptom levels varied between centres: 40\% of the total study population in Amsterdam reported depressive mood against only 26\% in Zaragoza. To incorporate studies from other centres using other methods for depression identification, the EURO-D scale was developed from 12 items of the GMS and validated against other scales and expert diagnosis. A two factor solution emerged, an 'affective suffering factor' and a 'motivation factor'. The EURO-D scale was applied to 14 population based surveys. Depression score tended to increase with age unlike levels of prevalence of depression. Large between centre differences were evident in levels of depression unexplained by age, gender or marital status. These data show that depressive illness defined as suitable for intervention is common among older people in Europe. Opportunities for effective treatment are almost certainly being lost. Levels of depressive symptoms vary significantly between high and low scoring centres, prompting the next phase of this study, an examination of risk factors in Europe.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hospitalisation for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSHs) has become a recognised tool to measure access to primary care. Timely and effective outpatient care is highly relevant to refugee populations given the past exposure to torture and trauma, and poor access to adequate health care in their countries of origin and during flight. Little is known about ACSHs among resettled refugee populations. With the aim of examining the hypothesis that people from refugee backgrounds have higher ACSHs than people born in the country of hospitalisation, this study analysed a six-year state-wide hospital discharge dataset to estimate ACSH rates for residents born in refugee-source countries and compared them with the Australia-born population. METHODS: Hospital discharge data between 1 July 1998 and 30 June 2004 from the Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset were used to assess ACSH rates among residents born in eight refugee-source countries, and compare them with the Australia-born average. Rate ratios and 95\% confidence levels were used to illustrate these comparisons. Four categories of ambulatory care sensitive conditions were measured: total, acute, chronic and vaccine-preventable. Country of birth was used as a proxy indicator of refugee status. RESULTS: When compared with the Australia-born population, hospitalisations for total and acute ambulatory care sensitive conditions were lower among refugee-born persons over the six-year period. Chronic and vaccine-preventable ACSHs were largely similar between the two population groups. CONCLUSION: Contrary to our hypothesis, preventable hospitalisation rates among people born in refugee-source countries were no higher than Australia-born population averages. More research is needed to elucidate whether low rates of preventable hospitalisation indicate better health status, appropriate health habits, timely and effective care-seeking behaviour and outpatient care, or overall low levels of health care-seeking due to other more pressing needs during the initial period of resettlement. It is important to unpack dimensions of health status and health care access in refugee populations through ad-hoc surveys as the refugee population is not a homogenous group despite sharing a common experience of forced displacement and violence-related trauma.}

  abstract = {Infectious diseases are more prevalent in older people than in younger adults, and represent a major healthcare issue in older populations. Indeed, infections in the elderly are often associated with higher morbidity and mortality, and may present atypically. Additionally, older patients are generally treated with polypharmacy regimens, which increase the likelihood of drug-drug interactions when the prescription of an antimicrobial agent is needed. A progressive impairment in the functional reserve of multiple organs may affect either pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics during aging. Changes in body composition occurring with advancing age, reduced liver mass and perfusion, and reduced renal excretion may affect either pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. These issues need to be taken into account when prescribing antimicrobial agents to older complex patients taking multiple drugs. Interventions aimed at improving the appropriateness and safety of antimicrobial prescriptions have been proposed. Educational interventions targeting physicians may improve antimicrobial prescriptions. Antimicrobial stewardship programmes have been found to reduce the length of hospital stay and improve safety in hospitalized patients, and their use in long-term care facilities is worth testing. Computerized prescription and decision support systems, as well as interventions aimed at improving antimicrobial agents dosage in relation to kidney function, may also help to reduce the burden of interactions and inherent costs.},

Two independent reviewers assessed quality of eligible studies and extracted data. Meta-analyses were conducted for studies presenting similar outcomes.Results The review included 24 studies; 22 involved patients with symptomatic infection and two involved healthy volunteers; 19 were observational studies (of which two were prospective) and five were randomised trials. In five studies of urinary tract bacteria (14\,348 participants), the pooled odds ratio (OR) for resistance was 2.5 (95\% confidence interval 2.1 to 2.9) within 2 months of antibiotic treatment and 1.33 (1.2 to 1.5) within 12 months. In seven studies of respiratory tract bacteria (2605 participants), pooled ORs were 2.4 (1.4 to 3.9) and 2.4 (1.3 to 4.5) for the same periods, respectively. Studies reporting the quantity of antibiotic prescribed found that longer duration and multiple courses were associated with higher rates of resistance. Studies comparing the potential for different antibiotics to induce resistance showed no consistent effects. Only one prospective study reported changes in resistance over a long period; pooled ORs fell from 12.2 (6.8 to 22.1) at 1 week to 6.1 (2.8 to 13.4) at 1 month, 3.6 (2.2 to 6.0) at 2 months, and 2.2 (1.3 to 3.6) at 6 months.Conclusions Individuals prescribed an antibiotic in primary care for a respiratory or urinary infection develop bacterial resistance to that antibiotic. The effect is greatest in the month immediately after treatment but may persist for up to 12 months. This effect not only increases the population carriage of organisms resistant to first line antibiotics, but also creates the conditions for increased use of second line antibiotics in the community.},

However, their relation to long-term mortality is unclear because few studies have rigorously considered potential confounders of the relation between depression and mortality, such as comorbid illness, functional impairment, and cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: To measure the association between depressive symptoms and long-term mortality in hospitalized older persons. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: General medical service of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: 573 patients 70 years of age or older. MEASUREMENTS: Depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale score), severity of acute illness (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score), burden of comorbid illness (Charlson comorbidity index score), physical function (a nurse assessed dependence in six activities of daily living), and cognitive function (modified Mini-Mental State Examination) were measured at hospital admission. Mortality over the 3 years after admission was determined from the National Death Index. Mortality rates among patients with six or more depressive symptoms were compared with those among patients with five or fewer symptoms. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 80 years; 68\% of patients were women. Patients with six or more depressive symptoms had greater comorbid illness, functional impairment, and cognitive impairment at admission than patients with fewer depressive symptoms. Three-year mortality was higher in patients with six or more depressive symptoms (56\% compared with 40\%; hazard ratio, 1.56 [95\% CI, 1.22 to 2.00]; P {$<$} 0.001). After adjustment for age, acute illness severity, comorbid illness, functional impairment, and cognitive impairment at the time of admission, patients with six or more depressive symptoms continued to have a higher mortality rate during the 3 years after admission (hazard ratio, 1.34 [CI, 1.03 to 1.73]). Although depressive symptoms contributed less to the mortality rate than did the total burden of comorbid medical illnesses, the excess mortality rate associated with depressive symptoms was greater than that conferred by one additional comorbid medical condition. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms are associated with long-term mortality in older patients hospitalized with medical illnesses. This association is not fully explained by greater levels of comorbid illness, functional impairment, and cognitive impairment in patients with more depressive symptoms.},

Despite this, the measurement and use of health literacy to guide discharge counseling and planning in heart failure patients is not commonly performed. A short 3-Question Brief Health Literacy Screen (BHLS) is available and takes less than three minutes to complete, but has never been evaluated to help determine whether health literacy affects healthcare use after discharge in patients with heart failure. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess 30-day readmissions and emergency department visits based on health literacy evaluated by the BHLS in an acute care heart failure population. METHODS: This was a prospective observational cohort study conducted at a large quaternary health system. Hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of heart failure were assessed for health literacy using the BHLS. Unplanned healthcare use after discharge including 30-day, all-cause ED visits and hospital readmissions was assessed using univariate and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty four patients aged 66.6~{\textpm}~14.3 (mean~{\textpm}~SD) years met inclusion/exclusion criteria of whom 175 (66.3\%) had a BHLS score {$>$}9 (adequate health literacy) and 89 (33.7\%) had a BHLS score {$\leq$}9 (low health literacy). Predictors of low health literacy included older age (p~=~0.019), lower education level (p~{$<~$}0.001) and unemployed (p~=~0.048). After controlling for potential confounders, low health literacy was independently associated with 30-day healthcare use after hospital discharge (OR:1.80; 95\% CI: 1.04-3.11; p~=~0.035). CONCLUSION: Using a short, 3-question validated survey instrument, it was demonstrated that low health literacy was associated with increased 30-day unplanned healthcare use after discharge in this heart failure population. These results provide a clinically useful, easily incorporated tool that could identify high-risk patients at need for clinical interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal Sepsis remains a significant burden globally, accounting for over 2.5 million neonatal deaths annually, with low-and middle-income countries  (LMIC) including Ghana disproportionately affected. The current study sought to  ascertain the prevalence of neonatal sepsis and associated factors based on  analysis of institutional records from Cape Coast Teaching Hospital (CCTH) in  Ghana. METHODS: The study involved a retrospective cross-sectional review of  randomly sampled medical records of 360 neonates CCTH from January 2018 to  December 2021. Descriptive proportions and binary logistic regression analysis  were conducted to estimate the prevalence of neonates with sepsis and associated  factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of neonates with sepsis over the period was  estimated to be 59\%, with early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) and late-onset  neonatal sepsis (LONS) accounting for about 29\% and 30\%, respectively. Neonatal  factors associated with sepsis were low Apgar score (AOR = 1.64; 95\%  CI:1.01-2.67, p = 0.047) and low birth weight (AOR = 2.54; 95\% CI:1.06-6.09, p =  0.037), while maternal factors were maternal education (AOR = 2.65; 95\%  CI:1.04-6.7, p = 0.040), caesarean deliveries (AOR = 0.45; 95\% CI:0.26-0.75, p =  0.003), maternal infection (AOR = 1.79; 95\% CI:1.09-2.94, p = 0.020) and  foul-smelling liquor (AOR = 1.84; 95\% CI:1.09-3.07, p = 0.020). CONCLUSION: The  study underscores the need for improved routine care and assessment of newborns  to prevent the onset of neonatal sepsis, with particular emphasis on the neonatal  and maternal risk factors highlighted in the current study.},

  abstract = {The past century was a period of increasing life expectancy throughout the age range. This resulted in more people living to old age and to spending more years at the older ages. It is likely that increases in life expectancy at older ages will continue, but life expectancy at birth is unlikely to reach levels above 95 unless there is a fundamental change in our ability to delay the aging process. We have yet to experience much compression of morbidity as the age of onset of most health problems has not increased markedly. In recent decades, there have been some reductions in the prevalence of physical disability and dementia. At the same time, the prevalence of disease has increased markedly, in large part due to treatment which extends life for those with disease. Compressing morbidity or increasing the relative healthspan will require "delaying aging" or delaying the physiological change that results in disease and disability. While moving to life expectancies above age 95 and compressing morbidity substantially may require significant scientific breakthroughs; significant improvement in health and increases in life expectancy in the United States could be achieved with behavioral, life style, and policy changes that reduce socioeconomic disparities and allow us to reach the levels of health and life expectancy achieved in peer societies.},

However, it is unknown whether low stress resilience earlier in life is related to subsequent development of type 2 diabetes. We examined whether low stress resilience in late adolescence is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in adulthood. METHODS: We conducted a national cohort study of all 1,534,425 military conscripts in Sweden during 1969-1997 (97-98\% of all 18-year-old men nationwide each year) without prior diagnosis of diabetes, who underwent standardised psychological assessment for stress resilience (on a scale of 1-9) and were followed up for type 2 diabetes identified from outpatient and inpatient diagnoses during 1987-2012 (maximum attained age 62 years). RESULTS: There were 34,008 men diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 39.4 million person-years of follow-up. Low stress resilience was associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes after adjusting for BMI, family history of diabetes, and individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic factors (HR for lowest vs highest quintile: 1.51; 95\% CI 1.46, 1.57; p {$<$} 0.0001), including a strong linear trend across the full range of stress resilience (p trend {$<$} 0.0001). This association did not vary by BMI level, family history of diabetes or socioeconomic factors. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that low stress resilience may play an important long-term role in aetiological pathways for type 2 diabetes. Further elucidation of the underlying causal factors may help inform more effective preventive interventions across the lifespan.},

  abstract = {Aim: To develop and pilot an algorithm to select older people for different types of medication review based on their case complexity.Methods: Experts rated complexity of patient cases through a Delphi-consensus method. The case characteristics were included in a regression model predicting complexity to develop a criteria-based algorithm. The algorithm was piloted in four community pharmacies with 38 patients of high and low complexity. Pharmacists conducted medication reviews according to their personal judgment and rated the patients' complexity. Time needed for reviewing and number of interventions (proposed and implemented) were assessed. Feasibility was evaluated with in-depth interviews.Results: We developed the algorithm with 75 cases proceeding from patients in average 79 years old and using 10 prescribed medications. The regression model (adjusted R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.726, P {$<$} 0.0001) resulted in the following criteria for the algorithm: ``number of medications'' {\texttimes} 1 + ``number of prescribers'' {\texttimes} 3 + ``recent fall incident'' {\texttimes} 7 + ``does not collect own medication'' {\texttimes} 4. The pharmacists performed advanced medication reviews with all patients. The time needed to perform the medication review did not differ significantly according to case complexity (76.9 min for high complexity; 66.1 min for low complexity). Agreement between the algorithm scores and the pharmacists' ratings on complexity degree was slight to moderate (Kappa 0.16--0.42). The pharmacists had mixed opinions about the feasibility of applying the algorithm, particularly regarding the criterion ``fall incidents.''Conclusion: We developed an algorithm with four criteria that distinguished between high and low complexity patients as rated by experts. Additional validation steps are needed before implementation.},

  abstract = {The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) developed a practical clinical definition and consensus diagnostic criteria for age-related sarcopenia. EWGSOP included representatives from four participant organisations, i.e. the European Geriatric Medicine Society, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism, the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics-European Region and the International Association of Nutrition and Aging. These organisations endorsed the findings in the final document. The group met and addressed the following questions, using the medical literature to build evidence-based answers: (i) What is sarcopenia? (ii) What parameters define sarcopenia? (iii) What variables reflect these parameters, and what measurement tools and cut-off points can be used? (iv) How does sarcopenia relate to cachexia, frailty and sarcopenic obesity? For the diagnosis of sarcopenia, EWGSOP recommends using the presence of both low muscle mass + low muscle function (strength or performance). EWGSOP variously applies these characteristics to further define conceptual stages as 'presarcopenia', 'sarcopenia' and 'severe sarcopenia'. EWGSOP reviewed a wide range of tools that can be used to measure the specific variables of muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance. Our paper summarises currently available data defining sarcopenia cut-off points by age and gender; suggests an algorithm for sarcopenia case finding in older individuals based on measurements of gait speed, grip strength and muscle mass; and presents a list of suggested primary and secondary outcome domains for research. Once an operational definition of sarcopenia is adopted and included in the mainstream of comprehensive geriatric assessment, the next steps are to define the natural course of sarcopenia and to develop and define effective treatment.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: to examine the clinical evidence reporting the prevalence of sarcopenia and the effect of nutrition and exercise interventions from studies using the consensus definition of sarcopenia proposed by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP). METHODS: PubMed and Dialog databases were searched (January 2000-October 2013) using pre-defined search terms. Prevalence studies and intervention studies investigating muscle mass plus strength or function outcome measures using the EWGSOP definition of sarcopenia, in well-defined populations of adults aged {$\geq$}50 years were selected. RESULTS: prevalence of sarcopenia was, with regional and age-related variations, 1-29\% in community-dwelling populations, 14-33\% in long-term care populations and 10\% in the only acute hospital-care population examined. Moderate quality evidence suggests that exercise interventions improve muscle strength and physical performance. The results of nutrition interventions are equivocal due to the low number of studies and heterogeneous study design. Essential amino acid (EAA) supplements, including {$\sim$}2.5 g of leucine, and {$\beta$}-hydroxy {$\beta$}-methylbutyric acid (HMB) supplements, show some effects in improving muscle mass and function parameters. Protein supplements have not shown consistent benefits on muscle mass and function. CONCLUSION: prevalence of sarcopenia is substantial in most geriatric settings. Well-designed, standardised studies evaluating exercise or nutrition interventions are needed before treatment guidelines can be developed. Physicians should screen for sarcopenia in both community and geriatric settings, with diagnosis based on muscle mass and function. Supervised resistance exercise is recommended for individuals with sarcopenia. EAA (with leucine) and HMB may improve muscle outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) is a significant problem in health care today. We hypothesise that if doctors were given a single indicator of PIP and adverse drug reaction (ADR) risk on a patient's prescription, it might stimulate them to review the medicines. We suggest that a frailty index (FI) score may be such a suitable indicator.Objectives: to determine whether a positive relationship exists between a patient's frailty status, the appropriateness of their medications and their propensity to develop ADRs. Compare this to just using the number of medications a patient takes as an indicator of PIP/ADR risk.Setting and method: a frailty index was constructed and applied to a patient database. The associations between a patient's FI score, the number of instances of PIP on their prescription and their likelihood of developing an ADR were determined using Pearson correlation tests and {$\chi$}2 tests.Results: significant correlation between FI score instances of PIP was shown (R = 0.92). The mean FI score above which patients experienced at least one instance of PIP was 0.16. Patients above this threshold were twice as likely to experience PIP (OR = 2.6, P {$<$} 0.0001) and twice as likely to develop an ADR (OR = 2.1, P {$<$} 0.0001). Patients taking more than six medications were 3 times more likely to experience PIP.Conclusion: an FI score is a potentially relevant clinical indicator for doctors to critically assess a patient's prescription for the presence of PIP and ultimately prevent ADRs, especially when used in tandem with the number of medications a patient takes.},

  abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was to report on the all-cause readmission and repeat revascularization rates after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Background Although PCIs are frequently performed, 30-day rates of readmission and repeat revascularization after PCI are not known. Methods Retrospective analysis of a cohort of Medicare fee-for-service admissions associated with a PCI in 2005. Primary outcomes were 30-day all-cause readmission rates and 30-day readmission rates associated with a revascularization procedure. Results A total of 315,241 PCI procedures performed at 1,108 hospitals were included in the analysis. The all-cause 30-day readmission rate was 14.6\%, and the all-cause 30-day mortality rate was 1.0\%. All-cause 30-day mortality among readmitted patients was higher than patients who were not readmitted (3.6\% vs. 0.6\%; p {$<$} 0.001). The 30-day readmission rate of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients was significantly higher than that of non-AMI patients (AMI 17.5\%, non-AMI 13.6\%, p {$<$} 0.001). Among all patients readmitted within 30 days after the index PCI, 27.5\% had an associated revascularization procedure (PCI 25.8\%, coronary artery bypass grafting 1.7\%). The median readmission rates varied across hospitals, from 8.9\% in the lowest decile to 22.0\% in the highest decile. Conclusions A substantial proportion of PCI patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge, and readmission rates vary widely across hospitals. Readmissions within 30 days of an index PCI procedure were associated with a significantly higher 30-day mortality rate, and more than one-quarter of such readmissions resulted in a repeat revascularization procedure. These findings warrant further attention to determine whether these readmissions are preventable.},

  abstract = {Population ageing affects a country's ability to generate revenues for health. We simulate the effects of population ageing on the ability to raise revenues for health from income taxes, goods and services taxes, property taxes, and social contributions. We find that: -. For countries with a relatively younger population currently undergoing a rapid population age-structure transition, all revenue sources have the potential to grow considerably over the medium- to long-term. The challenge is to improve tax collection and the priority given to health to take advantage of this potential. -. For countries with a large share of the population at older ages, revenues from social contributions linked primarily to the labour market are expected to decline substantially as a result of population ageing. Three general policy options could address declining labour market-related social contributions due to population ageing. They include: -. expanding the revenue base by increasing the number of contributors, such as by increasing migration rates or increasing the effective retirement age; -. increasing the contribution rate on social contributions; and -. diversifying the mix of financing sources. Simulations suggest that these strategies in isolation are unlikely to fully compensate for the shortfall in revenues in countries that depend heavily on the labour market to finance health. Health and long-term care financing systems that are heavily reliant on labour market-related contributions may need to be redesigned if they are to continue to generate sufficient, stable revenues in the context of population ageing. This will require political commitment and a willingness to prioritize health. This research underscores the importance of moving away from financing health through labour-related contributions and premiums and, as a result, de-linking entitlement to care from the payment of contributions. Taxation policies can ensure health financing is both sustainable and equitable.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa are being increasingly described worldwide. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying  carbapenem resistance in an extremely drug-resistant P. aeruginosa isolate from a  neonatal intensive care unit in Morocco. MATERIALS AND METHODS: P. aeruginosa  strain O82J1 was identified using MALDI-TOF-MS. Carba NP, immunochromatographic  assay NG Carba5 and antimicrobial susceptibility testing using disc diffusion and  microbroth were performed. Whole-genome sequencing using the Illumina and MinION  technologies and different software packages available at the Center of Genomic  Epidemiology were used to predict the resistome, sequence type and plasmid types.  RESULTS: P. aeruginosa O82J1 co-expressed two metallo-{$\beta$}-lactamases, blaNDM-1 and  blaVIM-2, and was susceptible to colistin and apramycin only. It belonged to  ST773 that is frequently reported worldwide as a high-risk P. aeruginosa clone.  The blaVIM-2 gene was integron-borne on a IncP-2 465-kb plasmid, whereas the  blaNDM-1 gene was chromosomally encoded and embedded in an integrative  conjugative element, probably at the origin of its acquisition. A total of 23  antimicrobial resistance genes were detected including a blaPER-1 ESBL gene, and  an 16S-rRNA methyltransferase gene rmtB. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation of XDR P.  aeruginosa isolates expressing several carbapenemases in a neonatal intensive  care unit is of great concern due to the reduced treatment options, relying only  on colistin, but not recommended in neonates, and apramycin, not yet approved for  human therapy. Concerns were further elevated due to the resistance to  cefiderocol and ATM/AVI, two novel and last-resort antibiotics recommended to  treat infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, particularly XDR P. aeruginosa  in adults.},

  abstract = {Many medical journals, including JAMA, restrict the use of causal language to the reporting of randomized clinical trials. Although well-conducted randomized clinical trials remain the preferred approach for answering causal questions, methods for observational studies have advanced such that causal interpretations of the results of well-conducted observational studies may be possible when strong assumptions hold. Furthermore, observational studies may be the only practical source of information for answering some questions about the causal effects of medical or policy interventions, can support the study of interventions in populations and settings that reflect practice, and can help identify interventions for further experimental investigation. Identifying opportunities for the appropriate use of causal language when describing observational studies is important for communication in medical journals.A structured approach to whether and how causal language may be used when describing observational studies would enhance the communication of research goals, support the assessment of assumptions and design and analytic choices, and allow for more clear and accurate interpretation of results. Building on the extensive literature on causal inference across diverse disciplines, we suggest a framework for observational studies that aim to provide evidence about the causal effects of interventions based on 6 core questions: what is the causal question; what quantity would, if known, answer the causal question; what is the study design; what causal assumptions are being made; how can the observed data be used to answer the causal question in principle and in practice; and is a causal interpretation of the analyses tenable?Adoption of the proposed framework to identify when causal interpretation is appropriate in observational studies promises to facilitate better communication between authors, reviewers, editors, and readers. Practical implementation will require cooperation between editors, authors, and reviewers to operationalize the framework and evaluate its effect on the reporting of empirical research.}

Despite growth of initiatives targeting risk factors associated with potentially avoidable hospital readmissions, the impact of dementia on the likelihood of rehospitalization is poorly characterized. Therefore, the primary objective of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate whether dementia was an independent predictor of 30-day readmissions. Administrative claims data for all admissions to Rhode Island hospitals in 2009 was utilized to identify hospitalizations of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease or other dementias. Demographics, measures of comorbid disease burden, and other potential confounders were extracted from the data and the odds of 30-day readmission to any United States hospital was calculated from conditional logistic regression models. From a sample of 25,839 hospitalizations, there were 3908 index admissions of Medicare beneficiaries who fulfilled the study criteria for a dementia diagnosis. Nearly 20\% of admissions (n=5133) were followed by a readmission within thirty days. Hospitalizations of beneficiaries with a dementia diagnosis were more likely to be followed by a readmission within thirty days (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.18; 95\% CI, 1.08, 1.29), compared to hospitalizations of those of without dementia. Controlling for discharge site of care did not attenuate the association (AOR 1.21; 95\% CI, 1.10, 1.33).},

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study with split sample design for model validation. SETTING One large hospital Trust in the West Midlands. PARTICIPANTS All alive-discharge adult inpatient episodes between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2014. DATA SOURCES Anonymised data for each inpatient episode were obtained from the hospital information system. These included age at index admission, gender, ethnicity, admission/discharge date, length of stay, treatment specialty, admission type and source, discharge destination, comorbidities, number of accident and emergency (A\&E) visits in the 6\,months before the index admission and whether a patient was readmitted within 30 days of index discharge. OUTCOME MEASURES Clinical and patient characteristics of readmission versus non-readmission episodes, proportion of readmission episodes at each LACE score, regression modelling of variables associated with readmission to assess the effectiveness of LACE and other variable combinations to predict 30-day readmission. RESULTS The training cohort included data on 91\,922 patient episodes. Increasing LACE score and each of its individual components were independent predictors of readmission (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.773; 95\%\,CI 0.768 to 0.779 for LACE; AUC 0.806; 95\%\,CI 0.801 to 0.812 for the four LACE components). A LACE score of 11 was most effective at distinguishing between higher and lower risk patients. However, only 25\% of readmission episodes occurred in the higher scoring group. A model combining A\&E visits and hospital episodes per patient in the previous year was more effective at predicting readmission (AUC 0.815; 95\%\,CI 0.810 to 0.819). CONCLUSIONS Although LACE shows good discriminatory power in statistical terms, it may have little added value over and above clinical judgement in predicting a patient's risk of hospital readmission.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Among these diseases, heart failure (HF) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are the most common causes of hospitalization. Therefore, readmission for HF and AMI is receiving increasing attention. Several socioeconomic factors could affect readmissions in this target group, and thus, a systematic review was conducted to identify the effect of socioeconomic factors on the risk for readmission in people aged 65 years and older with HF or AMI. METHODS: The search was carried out by querying an electronic database and hand searching. Studies with an association between the risk for readmission and at least one socioeconomic factor in patients aged 65 years or older who are affected by HF or AMI were included. A quality assessment was conducted independently by two reviewers. The agreement was quantified by Cohen's Kappa statistic. The outcomes of studies were categorized in the short-term and the long-term, according to the follow-up period of readmission. A positive association was reported if an increase in the risk for readmission among disadvantaged patients was found. A cumulative effect of socioeconomic factors was computed by considering the association for each study and the number of available studies. RESULTS: A total of eleven articles were included in the review. They were mainly published in the United States. All the articles analyzed patients who were hospitalized for HF, and four of them also analyzed patients with AMI. Seven studies (63.6\%) were found for the short-term outcome, and four studies (36.4\%) were found for the long-term outcome. For the short-term outcome, race/ethnicity and marital status showed a positive cumulative effect on the risk for readmission. Regarding the educational level of a patient, no effect was found. CONCLUSION: Among the socioeconomic factors, mainly race/ethnicity and marital status affect the risk for readmission in elderly people with HF or AMI. Multidisciplinary hospital-based quality initiatives, disease management, and care transition programs are a priority for health care systems to achieve better coordination.},

In this paper we have mounted the evidence in support of  the proposal that neonatal sepsis meets all requirements for being a cause of ROP  (not a condition, mechanism, or even innocent bystander) by means of initiating  the early stages of the pathomechanism of ROP occurrence, systemic inflammation.  We use the model of etiological explanation, which distinguishes between two  overlapping processes in ROP causation. It can be shown that sepsis can initiate  the early stages of the pathomechanism via systemic inflammation (causation  process) and that systemic inflammation can contribute to growth factor  aberrations and the retinal characteristics of ROP (disease process). The  combined contribution of these factors with immaturity at birth (as intrinsic  risk modifier) and prenatal inflammation (as extrinsic facilitator) seems to  provide a cogent functional framework of ROP occurrence. Finally, we apply the  Bradford Hill heuristics to the available evidence. Taken together, the above  suggests that neonatal sepsis is a causal inducer of ROP.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Childhood adversity is a major risk factor for cardiometabolic health problems. Stress-related changes in diet suggest a role for endocrine factors that influence dietary intake, such as leptin and ghrelin. These hormones influence metabolism and may contribute to the relationship of early adversity, mental, and cardiometabolic health. This study examined levels of leptin and ghrelin in a sample of young adults with and without early life stress (ELS). METHODS: Young adults ages 18-40 (N = 200; 68.5\% female) were recruited from the community. Participants with ELS (N = 118) had childhood maltreatment, and a subset, n = 92 (78.0\%) also had parental loss, and n = 65 (55.1\%) also had a current psychiatric disorder. Control participants (N = 82) had no maltreatment, parental loss, or psychiatric disorders. Standardized interviews and self-reports assessed demographics, adversity, medical/psychiatric history, and health behaviors. Exclusion criteria included medical conditions and current medications other than hormonal contraceptives. Body Mass Index (BMI) and other anthropometrics were measured, and fasting plasma was assayed for total ghrelin and leptin with the Bio-Plex Pro Human Diabetes Panel. RESULTS: While ELS was significantly associated with greater leptin (r = .16, p = .025), a finding which held when adjusted for age and sex (F(3196)= 28.32, p = .011), this relationship was abolished when accounting for BMI (p = .44). Participants with ELS also had significantly lower total ghrelin (r = .21, p = .004), which held adjusting for age and sex (p = .002) and was attenuated (p = .045) when the model included BMI (F=46.82, p {$<$} .001). Current psychiatric disorder was also a significant predictor of greater leptin (r = .28, p {$<$} .001) and lower ghrelin (r = .29, p = .003). In the model with ELS and covariates, psychiatric disorder remained significant (F=7.26, p = .008) and ELS was no longer significant (p = .87). Associations with severity and recent perceived stress were also examined. CONCLUSION: The relationship of ELS and leptin was no longer significant when accounting for BMI, suggesting potential avenues for intervention. Ghrelin findings persisted after correction for BMI, which may be secondary to physiological differences in the regulation of these hormones (leptin is produced by adipocytes, whereas ghrelin is produced primarily in the GI tract). Lastly, these findings suggest that psychiatric functioning may be a key component contributing to the relationship of lower total ghrelin and childhood adversity.},

METHOD: This study developed, deployed, and evaluated whether community-based educational seminars enhance patient knowledge about antibiotic use. KEY FINDINGS: Twenty-eight participants from five locations completed the seminar. The antibiotic knowledge index score significantly increased by 2.0 points on the 14 point knowledge index from 10.95 (+/-2.88) to 12.95 (+/-1.72) (P = 0.0011) for the 19 participants completing both the pre and post-test.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To quantify the limitations associated with restricting readmission metrics to same-hospital only readmission. DESIGN: Using 2000-2009 California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Patient Discharge Data Nonpublic file, we identified the proportion of 7-, 15- and 30-day readmissions occurring to the same hospital as the initial admission using All-cause Readmission (ACR) and 3M Corporation Potentially Preventable Readmissions (PPR) Metric. We examined the correlation between performance using same and different hospital readmission, the percent of hospitals remaining in the extreme deciles when utilizing different metrics, agreement in identifying outliers and differences in longitudinal performance. Using logistic regression, we examined the factors associated with admission to the same hospital. RESULTS: 68\% of 30-day ACR and 70\% of 30-day PPR occurred to the same hospital. Abdominopelvic procedures had higher proportions of same-hospital readmissions (87.4-88.9\%), cardiac surgery had lower (72.5-74.9\%) and medical DRGs were lower than surgical DRGs (67.1 vs. 71.1\%). Correlation and agreement in identifying high- and low-performing hospitals was weak to moderate, except for 7-day metrics where agreement was stronger (r = 0.23-0.80, Kappa = 0.38-0.76). Agreement for within-hospital significant (P {$<$} 0.05) longitudinal change was weak (Kappa = 0.05-0.11). Beyond all patient refined-diagnostic related groups, payer was the most predictive factor with Medicare and MediCal patients having a higher likelihood of same-hospital readmission (OR 1.62, 1.73). CONCLUSIONS: Same-hospital readmission metrics are limited for all tested applications. Caution should be used when conducting research, quality improvement or comparative applications that do not account for readmissions to other hospitals.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our research sought to understand how falls risk, cognitive function, and daily function are associated with health related quality of life (using the EuroQol-5D) and quality of life (using the ICECAP-O) among older adults with mobility impairments. METHODS: The EQ-5D and ICECAP-O were administered at 12 months post first clinic attendance at the Vancouver Falls Prevention Clinic. We report descriptive statistics for all baseline characteristics collected at first clinic visit and primary outcomes of interest. Using multivariate stepwise linear regression, we assessed the construct validity of the EQ-5D and ICECAP-O using three dependent measures that are recognized indicators of "impaired mobility" - physiological falls risk, general balance and mobility, and cognitive status among older adults. RESULTS: We report data on 215 seniors who attended the Vancouver Falls Prevention Clinic and received their first clinic assessment. Patients had a mean age of 79.3 (6.2) years. After accounting for known covariates (i.e., age and sex), the ICECAP-O domains explained a greater amount of variation in each of the three dependent measures compared with the EQ-5D domains. CONCLUSION: Both the EQ-5D and ICECAP-O demonstrate associations with falls risk and general balance and mobility; however, only the ICECAP-O was associated with cognitive status among older adults with mobility impairments.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Individuals with limited health literacy often experience suboptimal health outcomes. This study examined the frequency of limited health literacy and demographic and psychosocial factors associated with limited health literacy in a sample of older Black Americans. METHODS: Participants (n\,=\,330) enrolled in a community-based intervention to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) screening completed baseline surveys assessing health literacy with the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine, Revised (REALM-R) test, CRC awareness, cancer fatalism, Preventive Health Model (PHM) constructs, and demographics. RESULTS: Approximately 52\% of participants had limited health literacy, the REALM-R score was 5.4 (SD\,=\,2.7). Univariable correlates of limited health literacy were gender, employment, income, prior screening, cancer fatalism, CRC awareness, and PHM constructs (religious beliefs, salience/coherence, perceived susceptibility). Multivariable correlates of limited health literacy were male gender (OR\,=\,2.3, CI\,=\,1.4-3.8), unable to work (OR\,=\,2.8, CI\,=\,1.3-6.1), lower household income (OR\,=\,3.0, CI\,=\,1.6, 5.5), and higher PHM religious beliefs (OR\,=\,1.1, CI\,=\,1.0-1.2). CONCLUSION: Limited health literacy was associated with multiple complex factors. Interventions should incorporate patient health literacy and low-literacy materials that can be delivered through multiple channels. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Future studies are needed to understand the role of health literacy in an individual's health behavior and the provision of effective healthcare.},

A cross-sectional study was carried out among general public in the State of Penang, Malaysia. A total of 888 participants were conveniently selected and completed the survey. A self-administered questionnaire was used to obtain the data from all the participants. Most of the participants (74.2\%) reported that they have adequate information about medicines provided on their medicine labels. In addition, 86.9\% of them reported that they read their medicine's label for the directions of usage and 84.3\% for the dosage instruction. However, 42.1\% of the participants do not read their medicine's label for the active ingredients, and 33\% of them do not read their medicine's label for the safety information. In addition, 36.5\% of the respondents did not read the label of medicine for the symptoms which can be used for. However, females, Malay respondents, and higher education level (college/university) were more likely to self-reported the reading medicine's label. Females were more likely to read the labels of medicines compared with males (OR~=~1.6, 95\% CI 1.20-2.13, P~=~.001). The reading of medicine labels was predicted by females, Malay respondents, and higher educated people.

Health knowledge about DM (HK-DM) may also influence individual health. We aimed to assess HL and HK-DM in patients with type 2 DM and their associations with metabolic control. METHODS: Our sample comprised 194 diabetic patients from a primary care health centre. We collected clinical and demographic data and applied two validated questionnaires, the Newest Vital Sign (NST) and Diabetes Knowledge Test (DKT), to assess HL and HK-DM, respectively. Metabolic control was defined as HbA1c {$<$} 7.0\%. Participants were classified according to the NST as having "high likelihood of limited HL" (HLL-HL), "possibility of limited HL" (PL-HL), or "adequate HL" (A-HL) and by the DKT as having "low", "average" and "good" HK. Statistical analysis included logistic regression models, using p {$<$} 0.05 as a cut-off for statistical significance. RESULTS: Overall, 72.7 and 34.7\% of participants had HLL-HL and low HK-DM, respectively. A-HL (OR = 6.02; 95\% CI: 1.691-21.450) and PL-HL (OR = 4.78; 95\% CI: 1.350-16.899) were significantly associated with better metabolic control than HLL-HL. We did not find a significant association between HK-DM and metabolic control. CONCLUSIONS: HL seems to be associated with better metabolic control. We also found a high prevalence of illiteracy and scarce knowledge about DM. Primary care physicians should promote HL to help patients achieve better metabolic control.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Falls are the main cause of accidental death in persons aged 65 years or older. METHODS: Using MEDLINE and previous reviews, we searched for prospective studies investigating risk factors for falls among community-dwelling older people. For risk factors investigated by at least 5 studies in a comparable way, we computed pooled odds ratios (ORs) using random-effects models, with a test for heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 74 studies met the inclusion criteria and 31 risk factors were considered, including sociodemographic, mobility, sensory, psychologic, and medical factors and medication use. The strongest associations were found for history of falls (OR = 2.8 for all fallers; OR = 3.5 for recurrent fallers), gait problems (OR = 2.1; 2.2), walking aids use (OR = 2.2; 3.1), vertigo (OR = 1.8; 2.3), Parkinson disease (OR = 2.7; 2.8), and antiepileptic drug use (OR = 1.9; 2.7). For most other factors, the ORs were moderately above 1. ORs were generally higher for recurrent fallers than for all fallers. For some factors, there was substantial heterogeneity among studies. For some important factors (eg, balance and muscle weakness), we did not compute a summary estimate because the measures used in various studies were not comparable. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provides comprehensive evidence-based assessment of risk factors for falls in older people, confirming their multifactorial etiology. Some nonspecific indicators of high baseline risk were also strong predictors of the risk of falling.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We studied neonates with suspected early-onset sepsis (EOS, sepsis developing in the first 72 hours after delivery) in Malawi to (1) describe  clinical characteristics and microbiological findings, (2) identify which patient  characteristics may be associated with pathogen positivity on blood culture, and  (3) describe mortality and its potential determinants. DESIGN: Prospective  observational study (May 2018-June 2019). SETTING: Neonatal ward in Queen  Elizabeth Central Hospital, the largest government hospital in Malawi. PATIENTS:  All neonates with suspected EOS in whom a blood culture was obtained. RESULTS:  Out of 4308 neonatal admissions, 1244 (28.9\%) had suspected EOS. We included 1149  neonates, of which 109 blood cultures had significant growth (9.5\%). The most  commonly isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,  Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumanii. Many of the  Gram negatives were extended-spectrum beta lactamase-producing  Enterobacteriaceae, and these were 40-100\%\,resistant to first-line and  second-line antimicrobials. Gestational age (GA) of {$<$}32 weeks was associated with  pathogen-positive blood cultures ({$<$}28 weeks: adjusted OR (AOR) 2.72, 95\%\,CI 1.04  to 7.13; 28-32 weeks: AOR 2.26, 95\%\,CI 1.21 to 4.21; p=0.005). Mortality was  17.6\% (202/1149) and associated with low birth weight ({$<$}1000\,g: AOR 47.57, 95\%\,CI  12.59 to 179.81; 1000-1500\,g: AOR 11.31, 95\%\,CI 6.97 to 18.36; 1500-2500\,g: AOR  2.20, 95\%\,CI 1.42 to 3.39; p{$<$}0.001), low Apgar scores at 5\,min (0-3: AOR 18.60,  95\%\,CI 8.81 to 39.27; 4-6: AOR 4.41, 95\%\,CI 2.81 to 6.93; p{$<$}0.001), positive  maternal venereal disease research laboratory status (AOR 2.53, 95\%\,CI 1.25 to  5.12; p=0.001) and congenital anomalies (AOR 7.37, 95\%\,CI 3.61 to 15.05;  p{$<$}0.001). Prolonged rupture of membranes was inversely associated with mortality  (AOR 0.43, 95\%\,CI 0.19 to 0.98; p 0.007). CONCLUSION: In Malawi, EOS was  suspected in nearly a third of neonatal admissions and had a high mortality. Ten  per cent were culture-confirmed and predicted by low GA. To reduce the impact of  suspected neonatal sepsis in least developed countries, improved maternal and  antenatal care and development of rapid point of care methods to more accurately  guide antimicrobial use could simultaneously improve outcome and reduce  antimicrobial resistance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive reserve hypothesis predicts that intellectually demanding activities over the life course protect against dementia. We investigate if childhood school performance remains associated with dementia once education and occupational complexity are taken into account. METHODS: A cohort of 440 individuals aged 75+ from the Kungsholmen Project was followed up for 9 years to detect dementia. To measure early-life contributors to reserve, we used grades at age 9-10 extracted from the school archives. Data on formal education and occupational complexity were collected at baseline and first follow-up. Dementia was ascertained through comprehensive clinical examination. Cox models estimated the relationship between life-course cognitive reserve measures and dementia. RESULTS: Dementia risk was elevated [hazard ratio (HR): 1.54, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.03 to 2.29] in individuals with low early-life school grades after adjustment for formal educational attainment and occupational complexity. Secondary education was associated with a lower risk of dementia (HR: 0.72, 95\% CI: 0.50 to 1.03), although the effects of post-secondary and university degrees were indistinguishable from baseline. Occupational complexity with data and things was not related to dementia. However, an association was found between high occupational complexity with people and dementia, albeit only in women (HR: 0.39, 95\% CI: 0.14 to 0.99). The pattern of results remained unchanged after adjustment for genetic susceptibility, comorbidities and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: Low early-life school performance is associated with an elevated risk of dementia, independent of subsequent educational and occupational attainment.},

We explored the association between 4 experiences throughout life-childhood socioeconomic circumstances, early-adulthood education, midlife occupational stress, and late-life social network-and the speed of chronic disease accumulation. We followed 2,589 individuals aged {$\geq$}60 years from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen for 9 years (2001-2013). Information on life experiences was collected from detailed life-history interviews. Speed of disease accumulation was operationalized as the change in the count of chronic conditions obtained from clinical examinations, medical histories, laboratory data, drug use, and register linkages over 9 years. Linear mixed models were used to analyze the data. Speed of disease accumulation was lower in individuals with more than elementary education (for secondary, {$\beta$} {\texttimes} time = -0.065, 95\% CI: -0.126, -0.004; for university, {$\beta$} {\texttimes} time = -0.118, 95\% CI: -0.185, -0.050); for active occupations compared with high-strain jobs ({$\beta$} {\texttimes} time = -0.078, 95\% CI: -0.138, -0.017); and for richer social networks (for moderate tertile, {$\beta$} {\texttimes} time = -0.102, 95\% CI: -0.149, -0.055; for highest tertile, {$\beta$} {\texttimes} time = -0.135, 95\% CI: -0.182, -0.088).

METHOD: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2018 with 118 elderly people with uncontrolled primary hypertension and inadequate health literacy. Self-management education was developed on the basis of the health literacy index. Medication adherence and blood pressure were assessed using 8-items Morisky Medication Adherence Scale and a mercury sphygmomanometer, respectively. RESULTS: At baseline, there were no significant between-group differences regarding participants' demographic characteristics, medical history, and medication adherence. After the intervention, between-group comparisons adjusted for pretest scores showed a significant reduction in the mean score of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and increase adherence to medication due to intervention (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). However, the proportions of controlled systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not statistically significant different between-group (P\,{$>$}\,0.05). CONCLUSION: Self-management education tailored to health literacy significantly promotes medication adherence but has no significant effects on control of blood pressure. PRACTICE IMPLICATION: To promote adherence to antihypertensive medications, tailored patient education to Health literacy is recommended. Limited pieces of evidence are available on the effectiveness of health literacy index-based interventions, so further studies are required.},

Low health literacy has been found in older people with heart failure, and less is known on the health literacy of caregivers whose patients are suffering from heart failure. DESIGN: Observational, multicentre, cross-sectional study. METHODS: From July 2015-May 2016, caregivers were recruited in five hospitals from Central and Southern Italy. To assess health literacy, the Italian version of the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy tool was used. RESULTS: A total of 173 caregivers participated in the research, the majority being females (60.1\%), aged between 46-60 years (52.6\%) and 96 (55.5\%) were from Central Italy. 33.5\% of caregivers were patients' children, and 16.2\% were paid caregivers of foreign origins. The average level of health literacy was adequate; however, lower levels were found among patients' spouses and those of older age. CONCLUSION: Our results, in contrast with previous studies, showed adequate health literacy levels of caregivers. However, caregivers older in age and with a low education level showed the lowest health literacy, emphasising the need for healthcare workers, to check caregivers' health literacy, before entrusting them with the care of patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As this research gives, for the first time, an overview on Italian caregivers' levels of health literacy, its results may be used to improve Italian healthcare professionals' knowledge of caregivers' health literacy, before entrusting them with the care of patients.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED: Unlike Anglo-Saxon countries, the rate of preventable readmissions is not a national quality indicator in France. In the context of the European research project Performance Assessment Tool for quality improvement in Hospitals (PATH), this pilot study provides a tool for health professionals to more easily identify preventable readmissions in order to analyze their causes. The objective of this work was to show the reliability of this tool. METHODS: We compared the rate of preventable readmissions occurring within 30 days, for a given disease, collected by analyzing medical reports (the gold standard rate of this study) to the rates of preventable readmissions occurring within 30 days, measured from algorithms using data from the French Programme of Medicalization of Information Systems (PMSI). The data were derived from PMSI data of the Lariboisiere-Fernand-Widal Hospital, a university hospital in Paris. RESULTS: The community-acquired pneumonia gold standard rate of preventable readmissions occurring within 30 days was 6.3 \%. Five algorithmic tools were used and measured rates between 2.9 \% and 7.9 \%. The positive likelihood ratios of these tools range from 8 to 308. CONCLUSION: This work presents a tool aimed at the health professionals that takes into account the diversity and complexity of the causes of avoidable readmissions, resulting from the quality of medical practice, the variability of the organization of hospital pathways and the links with ambulatory care.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Chronic heart failure (CHF) patients are frequently rehospitalized within 6 months after an episode of fluid retention. Rehospitalizations are preventable, but this requires an extensive organization of the healthcare system. In this study, we tested whether intensive follow-up of patients through a telemonitoring-facilitated collaboration between general practitioners (GPs) and a heart failure clinic could reduce mortality and rehospitalization rate. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hunderd and sixty CHF patients [mean age 76 {\textpm} 10 years, 104 males, mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 35 {\textpm} 15\%] were block randomized by sealed envelopes and assigned to 6 months of intense follow-up facilitated by telemonitoring (TM) or usual care (UC). The TM group measured body weight, blood pressure, and heart rate on a daily basis with electronic devices that transferred the data automatically to an online database. Email alerts were sent to the GP and heart failure clinic to intervene when pre-defined limits were exceeded. All-cause mortality was significantly lower in the TM group as compared with the UC group (5\% vs. 17.5\%, P = 0.01). The total number of follow-up days lost to hospitalization, dialysis, or death was significantly lower in the TM group as compared with the UC group (13 vs. 30 days, P = 0.02). The number of hospitalizations for heart failure per patient showed a trend (0.24 vs. 0.42 hospitalizations/patient, P = 0.06) in favour of TM. CONCLUSION: Telemonitoring-facilitated collaboration between GPs and a heart failure clinic reduces mortality and number of days lost to hospitalization, death, or dialysis in CHF patients. These findings need confirmation in a large trial.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between autism and the level of immunologic stimulation received from vaccines administered during the first 2 years of life. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed data from a case-control study conducted in 3 managed care organizations (MCOs) of 256 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 752 control children matched on birth year, sex, and MCO. In addition to the broader category of ASD, we also evaluated autistic disorder and ASD with regression. ASD diagnoses were validated through standardized in-person evaluations. Exposure to total antibody-stimulating proteins and polysaccharides from vaccines was determined by summing the antigen content of each vaccine received, as obtained from immunization registries and medical records. Potential confounding factors were ascertained from parent interviews and medical charts. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess associations between ASD outcomes and exposure to antigens in selected time periods. RESULTS: The aOR (95\% CI) of ASD associated with each 25-unit increase in total antigen exposure was 0.999 (0.994-1.003) for cumulative exposure to age 3 months, 0.999 (0.997-1.001) for cumulative exposure to age 7 months, and 0.999 (0.998-1.001) for cumulative exposure to age 2 years. Similarly, no increased risk was found for autistic disorder or ASD with regression. CONCLUSION: In this study of MCO members, increasing exposure to antibody-stimulating proteins and polysaccharides in vaccines during the first 2 years of life was not related to the risk of developing an ASD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It remains unclear whether depression increases the risk for dementia in the elderly. We evaluated the relationship between depressed mood at baseline and the incidence of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease, in the elderly living in the community. METHODS: A total of 1070 elderly individuals, aged 60 years or older, were identified as part of a registry for dementia in the Washington Heights community of North Manhattan, NY. In a prospective, longitudinal design with follow-up for 1 to 5 years, annual physician evaluation and neuropsychological testing were used to assess levels of cognitive impairment and to diagnose dementia. Depressive symptoms were evaluated with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Based on clinical considerations and a validity study, a positive score for the depressed mood item was used in statistical analyses. To confirm the results, the total Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score was also evaluated as the "depression" variable. RESULTS: Of the 1070 subjects, 218 met criteria for dementia at baseline evaluation. In the 852 subjects without dementia, depressed mood was more common in individuals with greater cognitive impairment. In a follow-up study of 478 of these subjects without dementia (mean +/- SD, 2.54 +/- 1.12 years of follow-up), the effect of baseline depressed mood on the end-point diagnosis of dementia (93\% had possible or probable Alzheimer's disease) was evaluated in a Cox proportional hazards model. Depressed mood at baseline was associated with an increased risk of incident dementia (relative risk, 2.94; 95\% confidence interval, 1.76 to 4.91; P {$<$} .001). This effect remained after adjustment for age, gender, education, language of assessment, Blessed Memory Information and Concentration test scores, and Blessed Functional Activity Scale scores (relative risk, 2.05; 95\% confidence interval, 1.16 to 3.62; P {$<$} .02). Similar results were obtained when the total Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score was used as the depression variable, with the use of the same covariates (relative risk, 1.07 per point interval; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.11; P {$<$} .01). CONCLUSIONS: Depressed mood moderately increased the risk of developing dementia, primarily Alzheimer's disease. Whether depressed mood is a very early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, or increases susceptibility through another mechanism, remains to be determined.},

STUDY SELECTION: We included observational studies that reported original data, measured literacy with any valid instrument, and measured one or more health outcomes. Two abstractors reviewed each study for inclusion and resolved disagreements by discussion. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer abstracted data from each article into an evidence table; the second reviewer checked each entry. The whole study team reconciled disagreements about information in evidence tables. Both data extractors independently completed an 11-item quality scale for each article; scores were averaged to give a final measure of article quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: We reviewed 3,015 titles and abstracts and pulled 684 articles for full review; 73 articles met inclusion criteria and, of those, 44 addressed the questions of this report. Patients with low literacy had poorer health outcomes, including knowledge, intermediate disease markers, measures of morbidity, general health status, and use of health resources. Patients with low literacy were generally 1.5 to 3 times more likely to experience a given poor outcome. The average quality of the articles was fair to good. Most studies were cross-sectional in design; many failed to address adequately confounding and the use of multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Low literacy is associated with several adverse health outcomes. Future research, using more rigorous methods, will better define these relationships and guide developers of new interventions.},

Health outcomes included health knowledge, health behaviors, use of health care resources, intermediate markers of disease status, and measures of morbidity. Two abstractors reviewed each study for inclusion. Included studies were abstracted into evidence tables and were assessed by using an 11-item quality scale. RESULTS: We reviewed 4182 new titles and abstracts published since 2003. Fifty-eight articles were retained for full review, and 13 met the inclusion criteria. Eleven articles from the systematic review from 1980 to 2003 met the inclusion criteria, giving us a total of 24 articles. Children with low literacy generally had worse health behaviors. Parents with low literacy had less health knowledge and had behaviors that were less advantageous for their children's health compared with parents with higher literacy. Children whose parents had low literacy often had worse health outcomes, but we found mixed results for the relationship of literacy to the use of health care services. Interventions found that improving written materials can increase health knowledge, and combining good written materials with brief counseling can improve behaviors including adherence. The average quality of the studies was fair to good. CONCLUSIONS: Child and parent literacy seems associated with important health outcomes. Future research can help us understand under what circumstances this relationship is causal, how literacy and health outcomes are related in noncausal pathways, the relative importance of parent and child literacy, and what interventions effectively reduce health literacy-related disparities.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine trends in UK primary care prescribing of medications potentially inappropriate for older people in the context of published international data. METHODS: Analysis of routinely collected anonymised computerised patient records in 131 UK general practices (approximately 162,000 registered patients annually aged {$>$}or=65 years) providing data to the DIN-LINK database between 1994 and 2003. In each year, we identified patients prescribed drugs classified by the 2003 Beers criteria as potentially inappropriate for older people. RESULTS: The level of potentially inappropriate prescribing remained steady over time: in 2003 32.2\% of patients received any Beers drug, and 20.5\% received a drug categorised as potentially "high risk"; percentages had been 32.9\% and 21.4\% respectively in 1994. In 2003, co-proxamol (93.7/1000 patients), benzodiazepines (52.4/1000 patients) and amitriptyline (45.4/1000, mainly at low doses) were the most frequently prescribed potentially inappropriate drugs. If co-proxamol (now being withdrawn) and low-dose amitriptyline (appropriate for neuropathic pain) are excluded, 24.8\% of patients still received a potentially inappropriate prescription in 2003. CONCLUSIONS: Prescription of potentially inappropriate medication, particularly benzodiazepines, to older people remains at a high level in the UK. Levels were higher than those seen in published data from the Netherlands, however the low rate of co-proxamol prescribing in the Netherlands explains much, but not all, of the difference. Future international comparisons, based on more careful delineation of the criteria, may play a valuable role in pharmaco-vigilance and can identify areas where regulation of prescribing may reduce risks to older patients.},

DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing waves 6 and 7. PARTICIPANTS: 5213 adults aged 60 or older. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates, incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95\% CI for falls in people with and without polypharmacy. RESULTS: A total of 5213 participants contributed 10\,502 person-years of follow-up, with a median follow-up of 2.02 years (IQR 1.9-2.1 years). Of the 1611 participants with polypharmacy, 569 reported at least one fall within the past 2\,years (rate: 175 per 1000 person-years, 95\%\,CI 161 to 190), and of the 3602 participants without polypharmacy 875 reported at least one fall (rate: 121 per 1000 person-years, 95\%\,CI 113 to 129). The rate of falls was 21\% higher in people with polypharmacy compared with people without polypharmacy (adjusted IRR 1.21, 95\%\,CI 1.11 to 1.31). Using {$\geq$}4 drugs threshold the rate of falls was 18\% higher in people with polypharmacy compared with people without (adjusted IRR 1.18, 95\%\,CI 1.08 to 1.28), whereas using {$\geq$}10 drugs threshold polypharmacy was associated with a 50\% higher rate of falls (adjusted IRR 1.50, 95\%\,CI 1.34 to 1.67). CONCLUSIONS: We found almost one-third of the total population using five or more drugs, which was significantly associated with 21\% increased rate of falls over a 2-year period.

  abstract = {Readmission within 30 days after hospital discharge for common cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure and acute myocardial infarction is extremely common among older persons. To incentivize investment in reducing preventable rehospitalizations, the United States federal government has directed increasing financial penalties to hospitals with higher-than-expected 30-day readmission rates. Uncertainty exists, however, regarding the best approaches to reducing these adverse outcomes. In this review, we summarize the literature on predictors of 30-day readmission, the utility of risk prediction models, and strategies to reduce short-term readmission after hospitalization for heart failure and acute myocardial infarction. We report that few variables have been found to consistently predict the occurrence of 30-day readmission and that risk prediction models lack strong discriminative ability. We additionally report that the literature on interventions to reduce 30-day rehospitalization has significant limitations due to heterogeneity, susceptibility to bias, and lack of reporting on important contextual factors and details of program implementation. New information is characterizing the period after hospitalization as a time of high generalized risk, which has been termed the post-hospital syndrome. This framework for characterizing inherent post-discharge instability suggests new approaches to reducing readmissions.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Type 2 diabetes affects approximately 8 percent of adults in the United States. Some risk factors --- elevated plasma glucose concentrations in the fasting state and after an oral glucose load, overweight, and a sedentary lifestyle --- are potentially reversible. We hypothesized that modifying these factors with a lifestyle-intervention program or the administration of metformin would prevent or delay the development of diabetes. METHODS We randomly assigned 3234 nondiabetic persons with elevated fasting and post-load plasma glucose concentrations to placebo, metformin (850 mg twice daily), or a lifestyle-modification program with the goals of at least a 7 percent weight loss and at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week. The mean age of the participants was 51 years, and the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 34.0; 68 percent were women, and 45 percent were members of minority groups. RESULTS The average follow-up was 2.8 years. The incidence of diabetes was 11.0, 7.8, and 4.8 cases per 100 person-years in the placebo, metformin, and lifestyle groups, respectively. The lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence by 58 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 48 to 66 percent) and metformin by 31 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 43 percent), as compared with placebo; the lifestyle intervention was significantly more effective than metformin. To prevent one case of diabetes during a period of three years, 6.9 persons would have to participate in the lifestyle-intervention program, and 13.9 would have to receive metformin. CONCLUSIONS Lifestyle changes and treatment with metformin both reduced the incidence of diabetes in persons at high risk. The lifestyle intervention was more effective than metformin.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor participant understanding of research information can be a problem in community interventional studies with rural African women, whose  levels of illiteracy are high. This study aimed to improve the informed consent  process for women living in rural eastern Uganda. We assessed the impact of  alternative consent models on participants' understanding of clinical trial  information and their contribution to the informed consent process in rural  Uganda. METHODS: The study applied a parallel mixed-methods design for a  prospective comparative cohort, nested within a pilot study on the community  distribution of an alcohol-based hand rub to prevent neonatal sepsis (BabyGel  pilot trial). Women of at least 34~weeks' pregnancy, suitable for inclusion in  the BabyGel pilot trial, were recruited into this study from their homes in 13  villages in Mbale District. As part of the informed consent process, information  about the trial was presented using one of three consent methods: standard  researcher-read information, a slide show using illustrated text on a flip chart  or a video showing the patient information being read as if by a newsreader in  either English or the local language. In addition, all women received the patient  information sheet in their preferred language. Each information-giving method was  used in recruitment for 1 week. Two days after recruitment, women's understanding  of the clinical trial was evaluated using the modified Quality of Informed  Consent (QuIC) tool. They were also shown the other two methods and their  preference assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. Semi-structured interviews were  administered to each participant. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed  and translated verbatim, and thematically analysed. RESULTS: A total of 30  pregnant women in their homes participated in this study. Their recall of the  trial information within the planned 48~h was assessed for the majority (90\%,  27/30). For all three consent models, women demonstrated a high understanding of  the study. There was no statistically significant difference between the  slide-show message (mean 4.7; standard deviation, SD 0.47; range 4-5), video  message (mean 4.9; SD 0.33; range 4-5) and standard method (mean 4.5; SD 0.53;  range 4-5; all one-way ANOVA, p~=\,0.190). The slide-show message resulted in the  most objective understanding of question items with the highest average QuIC  score of 100 points. For women who had been recruited using any of the three  models, the slide show was the most popular method, with a mean score for all  items of not less than 4.2 (mean 4.8; SD 0.6; range 4-5). Most women (63\%, 19/30)  preferred the slide-show message, compared with 17\% (5/30) and 20\% (6/30) for the  standard and video messages, respectively. The reasons given included the  benefits of having pictures to aid understanding and the logical progression of  the information. CONCLUSION: Our results from this small study suggest that  slide-show messages may be an effective and popular alternative way of presenting  trial information to women in rural Uganda, many of whom have little or no  literacy.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis causes 0.5 million deaths annually, mostly in low resource settings. Babies born in African rural homes without running water or  toilet facilities are especially vulnerable. Alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) may be  used by mothers and carers as an alternative to hand washing with soap to prevent  neonatal infection. However, no definite study has established the preferred  formulation of hand rub for the mothers. This study aimed to assess the effects  of addition of bitterants and perfume towards the acceptability of the  alcohol-based hand rubs by the mothers in their homes after childbirth. METHODS:  This was a 3-way blinded cross-over study design. Mothers with children aged  {$\leq$}3~months were recruited from immunisation clinics at 3 local health facilities  in rural eastern Uganda and received 3-different ABHR formulations (in the order  plain, bitterant and perfumed) packed in 100~ml bottles. Each ABHR was used for 5  consecutive days followed by a 2-day 'washout' period (evaluation period).  Overall satisfaction with each hand rub was evaluated at the end of each week  using a 7-point Likert scale. RESULTS: A total of 43 women were recruited, whose  ages ranged from 16 to 45~years (mean 26.2~years old). None of the participants  normally used a hand protective lotion/cream. The three formulations were used  for a mean of 5 (range 3-7) days. A significantly greater volume of the  "bitterant" and "perfumed" formulations (mean 91 and 83~ml respectively) were  used in comparison to the "plain" formulation (mean 64~ml). Overall satisfaction  was high with all the hand rubs, but the perfumed formulation had a significantly  higher overall satisfaction score [mean 6.7, range 4-7] compared with the plain  [6.4, 3-7] and bitterant [6.2, 2-7] formulations. CONCLUSIONS: All the 3 ABHR  formulations were well accepted with little to choose between them. The ABHR with  added perfume scored highest on overall satisfaction and was used significantly  more often than plain ABHR. ABHR with bitterant additive did, however, score  highly and may be a preferable choice to those with concern over alcohol misuse.

METHODS: Nationwide survey of family caregivers of people with spinal cord injury (N\,=\,717). Caregivers aged 18+ who assisted with activities of daily living were included. Self-reported information seeking behavior, including topics, preferred sources, and health literacy were assessed and analyzed. RESULTS: Health professionals were the most trusted source of information. Among information-seekers, higher health literacy levels were shown to be associated with lower subjective caregiver burden and, in turn, with higher caregivers' satisfaction with own health. CONCLUSION: Caregivers use information on different topics and coming from different sources. In order for information to improve the caregiving experience, however, caregivers need health literacy skills to make sense of it. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Building health literacy is a promising approach to support caregivers in their activities, reduce their subjective burden, and even to improve their health. Interventions should consider involving health professionals, as the most trusted source of information, and address both health-related and more practical issues.},

  abstract = {Linked data are increasingly being used for epidemiological research, to enhance primary research, and in planning, monitoring and evaluating public policy and services. Linkage error (missed links between records that relate to the same person or false links between unrelated records) can manifest in many ways: as missing data, measurement error and misclassification, unrepresentative sampling, or as a special combination of these that is specific to analysis of linked data: the merging and splitting of people that can occur when two hospital admission records are counted as one person admitted twice if linked and two people admitted once if not. Through these mechanisms, linkage error can ultimately lead to information bias and selection bias; so identifying relevant mechanisms is key in quantitative bias analysis. In this article we introduce five key concepts and a study classification system for identifying which mechanisms are relevant to any given analysis. We provide examples and discuss options for estimating parameters for bias analysis. This conceptual framework provides the `links' between linkage error, information bias and selection bias, and lays the groundwork for quantitative bias analysis for linkage error.},

Records with a prescription for systemic antibiotics were extracted and linked to co-occurring diagnostic codes, which were used to attribute prescriptions to clinical conditions. We further assessed which antibiotic classes were prescribed and which conditions resulted in the greatest share of prescribing.The prescribing rate varied considerably among participating practices, with a median of 626 prescriptions/1000 patients (IQR 543--699). In total, 69\% of antibiotic prescriptions (n\,=\,3\,156\,507) could be linked to a body system and/or clinical condition. Of these prescriptions, 46\% were linked to conditions of the respiratory tract, including ear, nose and throat (RT/ENT); leading conditions within this group were cough symptoms (22.7\%), lower respiratory tract infection (RTI) (17.9\%), sore throat (16.7\%) and upper RTI (14.5\%). After RT/ENT infections, infections of the urogenital tract (22.7\% of prescriptions linked to a condition) and skin/wounds (16.4\%) accounted for the greatest share of prescribing. Penicillins accounted for 50\% of all prescriptions, followed by macrolides (13\%), tetracyclines (12\%) and trimethoprim (11\%).The majority of antibiotic prescriptions in English primary care were for infections of the respiratory and urinary tracts. However, in almost one-third of all prescriptions no clinical justification was documented. Antibiotic prescribing rates varied substantially between practices, suggesting that there is potential to reduce prescribing in at least some practices.},

  abstract = {Before assessment can begin we must decide how quality is to be defined and that depends on whether one assesses only the performance of practitioners or also the contributions of patients and of the health care system; on how broadly health and responsibility for health are defined; on whether the maximally effective or optimally effective care is sought; and on whether individual or social preferences define the optimum. We also need detailed information about the causal linkages among the structural attributes of the settings in which care occurs, the processes of care, and the outcomes of care. Specifying the components or outcomes of care to be sampled, formulating the appropriate criteria and standards, and obtaining the necessary information are the steps that follow. Though we know much about assessing quality, much remains to be known.(JAMA 1988;260:1743-1748)},

  abstract = {Objective: To understand the health literacy of the cancer prevention and treatment among urban residents of China, and explore the related factors. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 16 provinces covered by the Cancer Screening Program in Urban China (CanSPUC) from 2015 to 2017. A total of 32 257 local residents aged {$\geq$}18 years old who could understand the investigation procedure were included in the study by using the cluster sampling method and convenient sampling method. All local residents were categorized into four groups, which contained 15 524 community residents, 8 016 cancer risk assessment/screening population, 2 289 cancer patients and 6 428 occupational population, respectively. The health literacy of the cancer prevention, early discovery, early diagnosis, early treatment and the demands of cancer prevention and treatment knowledge was analyzed. The level of health literacy among different groups were calculated and compared. The binary logistic regression model was used to analyze the influencing factors of the health literacy of the cancer prevention and treatment. Results: The level of health literacy of the cancer prevention and treatment was 56.97\% among all study population; in each group it was 55.01\% for community residents, 59.08\% for cancer risk assessment/screening population, 61.99\% for cancer patients and 57.31\% for occupational population, respectively (P{$<$}0.001). The level of health literacy of the cancer prevention and treatment of residents aged 50 to 69 years old, other occupational groups, unmarried, the central and western region residents and the group with unclear self-assessment of cancer risk was significantly lower than that of residents younger than 40 years old, personnel of public institutions/civil servants, married, the eastern region residents and the group whose self-assessment without cancer risk (P{$<$}0.05) . The level of health literacy of cancer prevention and treatment of females, people who went to high school or over, cancer risk assessment/screening population, cancer patients and occupational population was significantly higher than that of males, people who had an education level of primary school or below and community residents (P{$<$}0.05) . Conclusion: The health literacy of the cancer prevention and treatment of urban residents in China was relatively high, but there was still room for improvement. Gender, age, educational level, occupation, region, marital status, self-assessment of cancer risk, and type of respondents were the key influencing factors of the health literacy of the cancer prevention and treatment. Male, 50-69 years old, lower educational level, central and western regions, unclear cancer risk self-assessment, and without specific environmental exposure to cancer prevention and treatment knowledge or related risk factors were the characteristics of the key intervention group of the health literacy of the cancer prevention and treatment.},

Based on these correlational findings, researchers have developed and tested complex developmental models and have examined biological moderating factors (e.g., gene--environment interactions).             In this context, we stress the critical need for researchers to use family-based, quasi-experimental designs when trying to integrate genetic and social science research involving environmental variables because these designs rigorously examine causal inferences by testing competing hypotheses.             We argue that sibling comparison, offspring of twins or siblings, in vitro fertilization designs, and other genetically informed approaches play a unique role in bridging gaps between basic biological and social science research. We use studies on maternal smoking during pregnancy to exemplify these principles.},

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary readmission diagnoses of readmissions within 30 days of discharge and potentially avoidable 30 day readmissions to the index hospital or two other hospitals in its network. RESULTS: Among 10,731 discharges, 2398 (22.3\%) were followed by a 30 day readmission, of which 858 (8.0\%) were identified as potentially avoidable. Overall, infection, neoplasm, heart failure, gastrointestinal disorder, and liver disorder were the most frequent primary diagnoses of potentially avoidable readmissions. Almost all of the top five diagnoses of potentially avoidable readmissions for each comorbidity were possible direct or indirect complications of that comorbidity. In patients with a comorbidity of heart failure, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, or chronic kidney disease, the most common diagnosis of potentially avoidable readmission was acute heart failure. Patients with neoplasm, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease had a higher risk of potentially avoidable readmissions than did those without those comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: The five most common primary diagnoses of potentially avoidable readmissions were usually possible complications of an underlying comorbidity. Post-discharge care should focus attention not just on the primary index admission diagnosis but also on the comorbidities patients have.},

OBJECTIVE: To derive and internally validate a prediction model for potentially avoidable 30-day hospital readmissions in medical patients using administrative and clinical data readily available prior to discharge. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Academic medical center in Boston, Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS: All patient discharges from any medical services between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Potentially avoidable 30-day readmissions to 3 hospitals of the Partners HealthCare network were identified using a validated computerized algorithm based on administrative data (SQLape). A simple score was developed using multivariable logistic regression, with two-thirds of the sample randomly selected as the derivation cohort and one-third as the validation cohort. RESULTS: Among 10 731 eligible discharges, 2398 discharges (22.3\%) were followed by a 30-day readmission, of which 879 (8.5\% of all discharges) were identified as potentially avoidable. The prediction score identified 7 independent factors, referred to as the HOSPITAL score: h emoglobin at discharge, discharge from an o ncology service, s odium level at discharge, p rocedure during the index admission, i ndex t ype of admission, number of a dmissions during the last 12 months, and l ength of stay. In the validation set, 26.7\% of the patients were classified as high risk, with an estimated potentially avoidable readmission risk of 18.0\% (observed, 18.2\%). The HOSPITAL score had fair discriminatory power (C statistic, 0.71) and had good calibration. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This simple prediction model identifies before discharge the risk of potentially avoidable 30-day readmission in medical patients. This score has potential to easily identify patients who may need more intensive transitional care interventions.},

OBJECTIVE: To identify the risk factors for having a 30-day potentially avoidable readmission due to end-of-life care issues among all medical patients. DESIGN: Nested case-control study. SETTING/PATIENTS: All 10,275 consecutive discharges from any medical service of an academic tertiary medical center in Boston, Massachusetts between July 1, 2009 and June 30, 2010. MEASUREMENTS: A random sample of all the potentially avoidable 30-day readmissions was independently reviewed by 9 trained physicians to identify the ones due to end-of-life issues. RESULTS: Among 534, 30-day potentially avoidable readmission cases reviewed, 80 (15\%) were due to an end-of-life care issue. In multivariable analysis, the following risk factors were significantly associated with a 30-day potentially avoidable readmission due to end-of-life care issues: number of admissions in the previous 12 months (odds ratio [OR]: 1.10 per admission, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.20), neoplasm (OR: 5.60, 95\% CI: 2.85-10.98), opiate medications at discharge (OR: 2.29, 95\% CI: 1.29-4.07), Elixhauser comorbidity index (OR: 1.16 per 5-point increase, 95\% CI: 1.10-1.22). The discrimination of the model (C statistic) was 0.85. CONCLUSIONS: In a medical population, we identified 4 main risk factors that were significantly associated with 30-day potentially avoidable readmission due to end-of-life care issues, producing a model with very good to excellent discrimination. Patients with these risk factors might benefit from palliative care consultation prior to discharge in order to improve end-of-life care and possibly reduce unnecessary rehospitalizations.},

OBJECTIVE: To externally validate the ``HOSPITAL'' score in an international multicenter study to assess its generalizability. DESIGN: International multicenter retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 9 large hospitals across 4 different countries. PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients consecutively discharged alive from a medical department between January and December, 2011 (117,065 participants). Patients transferred to another acute care facility were excluded. EXPOSURES: The ``HOSPITAL'' score includes the following predictors at discharge: Hemoglobin, discharge from an Oncology service, Sodium level, Procedure during the index admission, Index Type of admission (urgent), number of Admissions during the last 12 months, and Length of stay. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 30-day potentially avoidable readmission to the index hospital using the SQLape algorithm. RESULTS: Of all medical discharges, 14.5\% (n=16,992) were followed by a 30-day readmission, and 9.7\% (n=11,307) were followed by a 30-day potentially avoidable readmission. The discriminatory power of the ``HOSPITAL'' score to predict potentially avoidable readmission was good with a C-statistic of 0.72 (95\% CI 0.72-0.72). As in the derivation study, patients were classified into 3 risk categories: low (62\%), intermediate (24\%), and high risk (14\%). The estimated proportions of potentially avoidable readmission for each risk category matched the observed proportion, resulting in an excellent calibration (Pearson goodness of fit test P=0.89). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The ``HOSPITAL'' score identified patients at high risk of 30-day potentially avoidable readmission with moderately high discrimination and excellent calibration when applied to a large international multicenter cohort of medical patients. This score has the potential to easily identify patients in need of more intensive transitional care interventions to prevent avoidable hospital readmissions.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Racial/ethnic disparities in surgical outcomes exist. Enhanced recovery programs (ERPs) have reduced some racial/ethnic disparities, but it remains unclear if disparities in experiences are also reduced. The purpose of this study was to use qualitative methods to better understand the surgical experience for African-American and Caucasian patients in the setting of an ERP. METHODS: Using purposeful sampling at a minority-serving institution, we recruited African-American and Caucasian patients who had undergone colorectal surgery under an ERP to six focus groups. Participants identified barriers and facilitators to a positive, or negative, surgical experience. Audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed using an indicative thematic approach with NVivo 10 software (QSR International). RESULTS: Forty-three patients (15 African-Americans and 28 Caucasians) participated in six focus groups. Six themes were identified by patients to be important in surgery: 1) knowledge about colorectal surgery, 2) obtaining information, 3) quality of information, 4) setting expectations about surgery, 5) following preoperative and postoperative instructions, and 6) confidence in surgery outcomes. For both racial/ethnic groups, patients felt that more information could have been provided, information should be given at their level of understanding, and trust in the physician made them feel confident in a positive outcome. African-American patients described experiences of having incorrect or no expectations on surgical outcomes, being provided inconsistent information, and feeling misled. African-Americans also described following instructions from family members and valued the importance of diet and exercise in recovery. CONCLUSIONS: African-American and Caucasian surgical patients have varied surgical experiences even under an ERP. All patients, however, valued the ability to obtain, process, and understand health information during the surgical process. These elements define "health literacy" and suggest the importance of providing health literacy-sensitive care in surgery.},

We conducted a cross-sectional survey in two family medicine clinics of the Mexican Institute of Social Security that included 778 diabetic patients {$>$}19~years of age. The Spanish version of the European Health Literacy questionnaire served to measure health literacy. Multiple logistic regressions were performed to determine the association between the independent variable (health literacy) and dependent variables (good self-rated health, glycemic control, and diabetes-related hospitalizations) after controlling for conceptually relevant patient's characteristics. Only 17.6\% of patients had adequate health literacy; while, the remaining percentage showed inadequate (23\%), or problematic (59.4\%) health literacy. After adjusting for the patients' characteristics, those with adequate health literacy had 4.66 (95\%CI: 2.26-9.61) times the odds of good self-rated health compared to those with inadequate literacy. Patients with adequate health literacy had 0.65 (95\%CI: 0.49-0.86) times the odds of hospitalization due to diabetes compared to those with inadequate literacy. Compared to inadequate health literacy, problematic literacy was associated with increased odds of glycemic control. In conclusion, healthcare providers should actively address the health literacy needs of patients to increase good self-rated health, glucose control and reduce hospitalizations.},

To explore whether the FI is a valid and adequate screening instrument for primary care, we conducted a systematic review of its psychometric properties.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: We searched the Cochrane, PubMed and Embase databases and included original studies focusing on the criterion validity, construct validity and responsiveness of the FI when applied in community-dwelling older people. We evaluated the quality of the studies included using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. This systematic review was conducted based on the PRISMA statement.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Of the twenty studies identified, eighteen reported on FIs derived from research data, one reported upon an FI derived from an administrative database of home-care clients, and one reported upon an FI derived from routine primary care data. In general, the FI showed good criterion and construct validity but lacked studies on responsiveness. When compared with studies that used data gathered for research purposes, there are indications that the FI mean score and range might be different in datasets using routine primary care data; however, this finding needs further investigation.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the FI is a valid frailty screening instrument. However, further research using routine Electronic Medical Record data is necessary to investigate whether the psychometric properties of the FI are generalizable to a primary care setting and to facilitate its interpretation and implementation in daily clinical practice.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nTRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO systematic review register number: CRD42013003737.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Chlamydia trachomatis is frequently overlooked as a cause of dysuria and urinary frequency in general practice patients. AIM This study set out to determine the impact of performing chlamydial antigen detection on sterile pyuria samples from patients aged 16-65 years and which were submitted to a hospital microbiology laboratory by general practitioners in the Winchester health district for routine microbiological investigations. METHOD Chlamydial antigen detection was performed by enzyme immunoassay and direct immunofluorescence. The cost of performing the test was estimated. In the first year of the study (1991) questionnaires were sent to general practitioners whose patients had a positive test result. RESULTS A total of 1025 samples of sterile pyuria were received at the laboratory between January 1991 and March 1993. Chlamydial antigen was detected in 54 samples (5\%); 22 men and 32 women aged between 16 and 57 years (mean 25 years). The detection rate was highest in the 16-20 years age group (22\% of men had a positive sample and 7\% of women). Completed questionnaires from 27 general practitioners revealed that 59\% of their patients were referred to the genitourinary clinic for treatment and contact tracing. The others were treated by the general practitioner. The cost of the screening programme per cure in this population was estimated to be 246 pounds. CONCLUSION C trachomatis is a significant pathogen which may go unrecognized and untreated. The cost, medically and financially, of screening for this pathogen and treating infected patients and contacts is likely to be less than ignoring it, particularly if screening is confined to the 16-30 years age group. General practitioners should consider the diagnosis of chlamydial infection in young adult patients with sterile pyuria, and microbiology laboratories should screen sterile pyuria samples for chlamydial antigen.},

RESULTS: Nineteen publications were included in the review. There was quality and consistent evidence that hypertensive patients with lower literacy had poorer knowledge. There was inconsistent evidence to show the relationship between health literacy and clinical outcomes, of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and blood pressure control; behavioral outcomes, of self-care, self-efficacy, adherence; patient-physician interactions outcomes, of patient-physician communication, patient trust, involvement in decision making and other outcomes. CONCLUSION: The person with low health literacy is likely to have poor knowledge of hypertension.

For example, misconceptions regarding treatment for upper respiratory infections (URIs), including nonjudicious use of antibiotics, have been described among Latinos. We sought to assess the influence of health literacy on knowledge and beliefs surrounding URI care and to explore the correlation between two health literacy measures among Latino parents in northern Manhattan. A descriptive survey design was used, and a total of 154 Latino parents were enrolled from four early head start programs between September 2009 and December 2009. Health literacy was measured using the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA) and Newest Vital Sign (NVS); parental knowledge and beliefs regarding antibiotic treatment for URIs were also assessed. Analyses were conducted in 2010 with multivariable logistic regression performed to examine predictors of health literacy. Inadequate health literacy was observed in 83.8~\% of respondents using NVS and 35.7~\% with the S-TOFHLA. College education was significantly associated with adequate health literacy using either the NVS or S-TOFHLA; however, other results varied between measures. Using NVS, there was a greater likelihood of adequate health literacy with US birth status (AOR 13.8; 95~\% CI, 1.99--95.1), {$>$}5~years US residency (AOR 7.6; 95~\% CI, 1.3--43.1) and higher antibiotic knowledge scores (AOR 1.7; 95~\% CI, 1.2--2.4). Using S-TOFHLA, the odds of adequate health literacy increased with access to a regular care provider (AOR 2.6; 95~\% CI, 1.2--5.6). Scores consistent with adequate health literacy on the NVS, but not the S-TOFHLA, were associated with correct beliefs regarding antibiotic use for URIs in comparison to scores of participants with inadequate health literacy. Since health literacy levels were low in this population and the risk of viral URI was high during the first few years of life, targeted education to improve health literacy, knowledge, and beliefs about URI and related antibiotic treatment is needed.},

There is no consensus, however, on how to evaluate benefits and risks of antibiotic use in agriculture, or the impact on public health. Recent soil resistome work emphasizes the importance of environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance (AR), and provides a starting point for distinguishing AR that can be impacted by agricultural practices from AR naturally present in a system. Manure is the primary vehicle introducing antibiotic drugs, AR bacteria and AR genes from animals into the environment. Manure management, therefore, impacts the transfer of AR from agricultural to human clinical settings via soil, water, and food. Ongoing research on the ecology of naturally occurring and anthropogenically derived AR in agroecosystems is necessary to adequately quantify the benefits and risks associated with use of antibiotics in food animals.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the consumer's perspectives and experiences regarding medication related problems (MRPs) following discharge from hospital. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online 80-question survey. SETTING: Survey participants were recruited through an online market research company. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred and six participants completed the survey. Participants were included if they were aged 50 years or older, taking 5 or more prescription medicines, had been admitted to hospital with a minimum stay of 24 h, admitted to hospital within the last 4 months and discharged from hospital within the last 1 month. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The survey comprised questions measuring: health literacy, health status, medication safety (measured by reported MRPs), missed dose(s), role of health professionals, health services and cost, and socio-demographic status. Descriptive and univariate statistics and logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the predictors of experiencing MRPs. RESULTS: Four main risk factors of MRPs emerged as significant: health literacy (P {$<$} 0.05), health status (P {$<$} 0.05), consumer engagement (P {$<$} 0.05) and cost of medicines (P = 0.001). Participants reporting a lack of perceived control over their medicines (OR 6.3; 95\% CI: 3.4-11.8) or those who played less of a role in follow-up discussions with their healthcare professionals (OR 7.6; 95\% CI: 1.3-45.7) were more likely to experience a self-reported MRP. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into consumers' experiences and perceptions of self-reported MRPs following hospital discharge. Results highlight novel findings demonstrating the importance of consumer engagement in developing processes to ensure medication safety on patient discharge.},

We aim to explain the 'distributed' nature of health literacy and how people living with a long-term condition draw on their social network for support with health literacy-related tasks such as managing their condition, interacting with health professionals and making decisions about their health. DESIGN: This paper reports a longitudinal qualitative interview and observation study of the development and practice of health literacy in people with long-term health conditions, living in South Wales, UK. Participants were recruited from health education groups (n = 14) and community education venues (n = 4). The 44 interview transcripts were analysed using the 'Framework' approach. RESULTS: Health literacy was distributed through family and social networks, and participants often drew on the health literacy skills of others to seek, understand and use health information. Those who passed on their health literacy skills acted as health literacy mediators and supported participants in becoming more health literate about their condition. The distribution of health literacy supported participants to manage their health, become more active in health-care decision-making processes, communicate with health professionals and come to terms with living with a long-term condition. Participants accessed health literacy mediators through personal and community networks. CONCLUSION: Distributed health literacy is a potential resource for managing one's health, communicating with health professionals and making health decisions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the last decade, electronic health (eHealth) literacy has attracted the attention of the scientific community, as it is associated with the self-management of patients with chronic diseases and the quality and cost of care. It is estimated that 80\% of people with chronic diseases are cared for at home by a family member, friend, or relative. Informal carers are susceptible to physical and mental health problems, as well as social and financial hardships. Nevertheless, there seems to be a research gap in terms of carers' needs, skills, and available resources in the age of new technologies, with the vital role of eHealth literacy of the carers remaining unexplored. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the level of eHealth literacy and health literacy of primary and secondary carers of people with dementia, to explore the association between health and eHealth literacy, as well as their association with the caregiving variables: self-efficacy, coping, and caring perceptions. METHODS: A sample of 200 primary carers (the carer who supports the people with dementia in everyday living) and 200 secondary carers (family member, friend, or other person in the social network assisting the primary carer in their role) will be recruited from dementia day care centers and Alzheimer's associations in Greece and Cyprus. The study will be a cross-sectional correlational descriptive study. Tools to be used include the eHealth Literacy Scale adapted for carers to measure eHealth literacy, European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire 16 (HLS-EU-Q16), Single Item Literacy Screener, Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-Efficacy, Carers of Older People in Europe~(COPE) index for caregiving perceptions, and COPE brief to measure selected coping strategies. Descriptive statistics will be reported, and correlations between different variables will be explored with parametric and nonparametric measures. RESULTS: As a preliminary study, the HLS-EU-Q16 has been validated in 107 older people. The internal consistency of the scale as estimated using Cronbach alpha coefficient was .77, somewhat lower than other validation studies. Recruitment of pilot study participants started in May 2017. CONCLUSIONS: Carers' eHealth literacy is a new field. Whereas previous studies have focused on the role and impact of low eHealth literacy and health literacy among older adults, the eHealth literacy of carers, and in fact carers of people with dementia, has not been explored. We hypothesize an association between eHealth literacy and health literacy level with carers' perceptions about caregiving role, self-efficacy, and coping strategies. A possible moderator in these associations is the secondary carers' eHealth and health literacy level, which will also be explored. By confirming the above hypotheses, tailored eHealth literacy interventions for carers of people with dementia and their families will be developed as a direct outcome of this research.},

METHODS: Qualitative study using content analysis of semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: Patient participation to frail elderly means information, not the wish to take part in decisions about their medical treatments. They view the hospital care system as an institution of power with which they cannot argue. Participation is complicated by barriers such as the numerous persons involved in their care who do not know them and their preferences, differing treatment strategies among doctors, fast patient turnover in hospitals, stressed personnel and linguistic problems due to doctors not always speaking the patient's own language. CONCLUSION: The results of the study show that, to frail elderly patients, participation in medical decision making is primarily a question of good communication and information, not participation in decisions about medical treatments. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: More time should be given to thorough information and as few people as possible should be involved in the care of frail elderly. Linguistic problems should be identified to make it possible to take the necessary precautions to prevent negative impact on patient participation.},

The patients were allocated to the intervention group (n=206) or control group (n=202). Mean age of the patients was 85.7 years, and 56\% were female. INTERVENTION This organizational form of care is characterized by a structured, systematic interdisciplinary CGA-based care at an acute elderly care unit. MEASUREMENTS The primary outcome was the change in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 3 months after discharge from hospital, measured by the Health Utilities Index-3 (HUI-3). Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, rehospitalizations, and hospital care costs. RESULTS After adjustment by regression analysis, patients in the intervention group were less likely to present with decline in HRQoL after 3 months for the following dimensions: vision (odds ratio [OR] =0.33, 95\% confidence interval [CI] =0.14-0.79), ambulation (OR =0.19, 95\% CI =0.1-0.37), dexterity (OR =0.38, 95\% CI =0.19-0.75), emotion (OR =0.43, 95\% CI =0.22-0.84), cognition (OR = 0.076, 95\% CI =0.033-0.18) and pain (OR =0.28, 95\% CI =0.15-0.50). Treatment in a CGA unit was independently associated with lower 3-month mortality adjusted by Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio [HR] =0.55, 95\% CI =0.32-0.96), and the two groups did not differ significantly in terms of hospital care costs (P{$>$}0.05). CONCLUSION Patients in an acute CGA unit were less likely to present with decline in HRQoL after 3 months, and the care in a CGA unit was also independently associated with lower mortality, at no higher cost.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a two year exercise programme of progressive balance retraining in reducing injurious falls among women aged 75-85 at increased risk of falls and injuries and living in the community. DESIGN: Pragmatic multicentre, two arm, parallel group, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 20 study sites in 16 medium to large cities throughout France. PARTICIPANTS: 706 women aged 75-85, living in their own home, and with diminished balance and gait capacities, randomly allocated to the experimental intervention group (exercise programme, n=352) or the control group (no intervention, n=354). INTERVENTION: Weekly supervised group sessions of progressive balance training offered in community based premises for two years, supplemented by individually prescribed home exercises. OUTCOME MEASURES: A geriatrician blinded to group assignment classified falls into one of three categories (no consequence, moderate, severe) based on physical damage and medical care. The primary outcome was the rate of injurious falls (moderate and severe). The two groups were compared for rates of injurious falls with a "shared frailty" model. Other outcomes included the rates of all falls, physical functional capacities (balance and motor function test results), fear of falling (FES-I), physical activity level, and perceived health related quality of life (SF-36). Analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS: There were 305 injurious falls in the intervention group and 397 in the control group (hazard ratio 0.81, 95\% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.99). The difference in severe injuries (68 in intervention group v 87 in control group) was of the same order of magnitude (0.83, 0.60 to 1.16). At two years, women in the intervention group performed significantly better on all physical tests and had significantly better perception of their overall physical function than women in the control group. Among women who started the intervention (n=294), the median number of group sessions attended was 53 (interquartile range 16-71). Five injurious falls related to the intervention were recorded. CONCLUSION: A two year progressive balance retraining programme combining weekly group and individual sessions was effective in reducing injurious falls and in improving measured and perceived physical function in women aged 75-85 at risk of falling.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00545350).},

A pooled within-group principal component analysis of cognitive test scores identified five components, three of which showed significant group differences. Verbal Recall and Maintenance of Set separated controls from major depressed patients and minor from major depressed patients. Executive Functioning separated controls from minor depressed patients, and Working Memory was borderline for separating controls from major depressed patients. The component representing Nonverbal Recognition was not statistically significant. Partial correlations controlling for age and education indicate that cognitive performance does decrease as severity of depression increases, and the magnitude of the change varies from a trend to a significant deficit depending on the cognitive domain. This decline in cognitive performance parallels a similar trend observed in neuroanatomical studies in which the volume of the frontal and temporal lobes decrease with increasing severity of depression.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate a new nontraditional value of the red cell distribution width (RDW) in predicting the clinical outcome  of neonatal sepsis. METHODS: In this retrospective study, data were collected  from the medical files of 500 full-term neonates with a diagnosis of early onset  or late onset sepsis. Baseline RDW and other traditional biomarkers, including  C-reactive protein (CRP), total leucocytic count, and platelet count were  analyzed in light of the clinical data. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality.  RESULTS: Red cell distribution width was significantly higher in nonsurvivors  compared with survivors (P {$<$} 0.0001). Red cell distribution width was  significantly elevated in infants with septic shock compared with those having  severe sepsis and those with sepsis (P {$<$} 0.0001). A strong positive correlation  was found between RDW and CRP (r = 0.8; P {$<$}0.0001). Red cell distribution width  had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75 for  prediction of mortality, which was almost equal to that of CRP and platelet  count. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis showed a positive association of  RDW with mortality (odds ratio, 1.31; 95\% confidence interval, 1.241-1.399).  CONCLUSIONS: Red cell distribution width is a useful prognostic marker in  neonatal sepsis. Larger prospective studies are required to confirm the value of  this routinely available marker in this category of patients.},

DESIGN: A systematic review was performed of studies that examined drug-related hospital readmissions. PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception through August 2016. Reference lists and a citation analysis on Web of Science and Scopus were also consulted. Two reviewers extracted study data with dual assessment of risk of bias. Prevalence and preventability of readmission due to drugs were calculated. Data were qualitatively summarized according to outcome. RESULTS: Nineteen studies met the eligibility criteria. Nine measured readmissions due to drug-related problems, seven due to adverse drug reactions, two due to adverse drug events, and one due to drug-drug interactions. Rates of readmissions due to drugs varied from 3\% to 64\% (median 21\%, interquartile range (IQR) 14-23\%). Readmissions were deemed preventable in 5\% to 87\% of cases (median 69\%, IQR 19-84\%). Evidence regarding the risk factors for drug-related readmissions and drugs causing these readmissions was inconsistent. CONCLUSION: Although studies show high variability in prevalence and preventability of drug-related hospital readmissions, readmissions due to drugs seem to occur often, especially in older adults. Further research is needed to specify the causes of preventable readmissions and implement effective interventions to reduce medication-related hospital admissions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Hospital readmissions are a current target of initiatives to reduce healthcare costs. This study quantified the association between having a clinical culture positive for 1 of 3 prevalent hospital-associated organisms and time to hospital readmission. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PATIENTS AND SETTING: Adults admitted to an academic, tertiary care referral center from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2008. METHODS: The primary exposure of interest was a clinical culture positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), or Clostridium difficile obtained more than 48 hours after hospital admission during the index hospital stay. The primary outcome of interest was time to readmission to the index facility. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to model the adjusted association between positive clinical culture result and time to readmission and to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 136,513 index admissions, the prevalence of hospital-associated positive clinical culture result for 1 of the 3 organisms of interest was 3\%, and 35\% of patients were readmitted to the index facility within 1 year after discharge. Patients with a positive clinical culture obtained more than 48 hours after hospital admission had an increased hazard of readmission (HR, 1.40; 95\% CI, 1.33-1.46) after adjusting for age, sex, index admission length of stay, intensive care unit stay, Charlson comorbidity index, and year of hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with healthcare-associated infections may be at increased risk of hospital readmission. These findings may be used to impact health outcomes after discharge from the hospital and to encourage better infection prevention efforts.},

AIMS: The primary aim of this study is to assess the potential determinants for both knowledge level of metabolic syndrome and health literacy (HL) level among the adult population. The second purpose of this study is to show whether there is a relationship between the MetS knowledge level and the HL level in western Turkey. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between October 10, 2017 and November 15, 2017 in western Turkey. The participants of the study were adult population who applied to seven "family health centers". The MetS knowledge level was measured with the Metabolic Syndrome Knowledge Level Scale (MetS-KS). HL level was measured with the HLS-EU-Q16. A General Linear Model was constructed to evaluate the relationship between MetS-KS scores and HLS-EU-Q16 scores. For statistical significance, P {$<$} 0.05 was accepted. RESULTS: Younger age, having higher education level, being single, having a high family income, not having a chronic disease, doing regular physical activity, viewing television less than 3 hours a day, previous measurement of waist circumference, previous attempts to lose weight, not being abdominally obese, not being at risk for hypertension and not having optimal body mass index (BMI) were associated with high HL levels (P {$<$} 0.05 for each one). According to the general linear model, the level of HL was not related to the level of MetS knowledge level (P {$>$} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Younger age, having a high educational level, high socioeconomic level and positive health behaviors were related with both MetS knowledge level and HL level. However, there was no direct relationship between MetS knowledge level and HL level.},

Methods:               We systematically searched PubMed and gray literature (2000--2012) for studies relevant to 14 hospital characteristics and 17 IQIs. We extracted data for study characteristics, IQIs analyzed, and hospital characteristics (e.g., teaching status, bed size, patient volume, rural vs. urban location, and nurse staffing).                                         Results:               We included 16 studies, which showed few significant associations. Four hospital characteristics (higher hospital volume, higher nurse staffing, urban vs. rural status, and higher hospital financial resources) had statistically significant associations with lower mortality and selected IQIs in approximately half of the studies. For example, there were no associations between nurse staffing and four IQIs; however, approximately 50\% of studies showed a statistically significant relationship between nurse staffing and lower mortality for six IQIs. For two hospital characteristics---higher bed size and disproportionate share percentage---all statistically significant associations had higher mortality. Five hospital characteristics (teaching status, system affiliation, ownership, minority-serving hospitals, and electronic health record status) had some studies with significantly positive and some with significantly negative associations, and many studies with no association.                                         Conclusions:               We found few associations between hospital characteristics and mortality IQIs. Differences in study methodology, coding across hospitals, and hospital case-mix adjustment may partly explain these results. Ongoing research will evaluate potential mechanisms for the identified associations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reliable local data for evaluating and planning neonatal interventions in low-resource countries are scarce. To provide data for  evaluating neonatal interventions in an administrative region of Ghana, the study  examined baseline data for inpatient neonatal services prior to the  implementation of a 5-years national action plan to reduce newborn deaths.  METHODS: This is a retrospective review of admissions and deaths registry for the  years 2013 and 2014 at 3 referral neonatal units representing district, regional  and tertiary referral centres in Greater Accra Region of Ghana. Perinatal, and  neonatal hospitalisation data were extracted. Chi-squared test was used to  compare outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 8228 newborn infants hospitalised for special  care, over 99\% had antenatal care and were delivered at a health facility, 96.7\%  and 91.7\% had birth weight and outcome data, respectively. Low birth weight  infants accounted for 48.5\% of total admissions and 67\% of deaths. Using birth  weight criteria, survival to discharge was 25.6\% for infants less than 1000grams,  67.9\% for 1000-1499grams, 88\% for 1500-2499grams and 88.7\% for infants 2500grams  and higher. Among infants with birth weight of 1000grams and higher, perinatal  asphyxia (70.6\%) and respiratory distress (16.4\%) accounted for most deaths.  CONCLUSION: There was significant burden of neonatal morbidity and mortality in  hospitalized newborns prior to the implementation of the national action plan.  The report provides a yardstick for assessing the impact of the national action  plan and comparative analysis of future interventions on neonatal outcome in the  region.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently initiated readmission reduction programs for certain noncancer index admissions. Intrinsic to this policy is the assumption that such readmissions are reasonably preventable and are due to inadequate management. For cancer patients, readmission frequency, characteristics, and their preventability have not been extensively evaluated. METHODS: We first electronically searched medical records of patients on our gastrointestinal oncology inpatient service to identify patients who had been discharged and then readmitted within 30 days. However, electronic review resulted in insufficient granularity of clinical records. Therefore, 50 of them were randomly selected for exhaustive manual review to assess the reasons for index admission and readmission, the nature of the index admission discharge plan, and whether the readmission was reasonably preventable or not, based on prespecified criteria. RESULTS: Between September 1, 2008, and March 1, 2013, 3995 gastrointestinal medical oncology patients had an index admission, of whom 876 (22\%) had {$\geq$} 1 readmission within 30 days. From the 50 manually reviewed records, the most common diagnosis categories for either the index admission or the readmission were infection, pain, and gastrointestinal issues. For 64\% of these patients, the diagnoses of the index admission and the readmission were different. Disagreement between the care team and patient/family about the index admission discharge plan was documented in 10\%. The readmission was determined to be preventable in 1 (2\%) of the 50 manually reviewed cases. CONCLUSIONS: Readmissions in this cancer population are common and reflect the refractory nature of these diseases and the high disease burdens. The vast majority of readmissions in this population, by our criteria, were not preventable. Our ongoing research in this vulnerable population includes efforts to better characterize and communicate care options, especially in the cases in which there was disagreement between the care team and patient/family.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Southeastern Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: Caregivers, aged 18 years or older, who provided supportive care of adults with IDDs. INTERVENTIONS: Survey and demonstration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (STOFHLA); a MAT~assessment consisting of interpretation of five sets of medication instructions followed by demonstration of understanding using a pill box; and a survey of caregivers' demographics, medication-related experiences, education, characteristics of persons for whom they provide care, and care-related activities performed. RESULTS: A total of 47 caregivers provided data. Caregivers had a mean age of 45.7 {\textpm} 14.6 years; 41 (87.2\%) were women and 38 (80.9\%) had education beyond high school. Caregivers were involved in obtaining medication from pharmacies, reminded the person with IDD to take medications and/or administered them to the person, documented medication and health information, and accompanied persons with IDD to physician offices. Most did not conduct monitoring procedures. The STOFHLA mean score was 34.5 {\textpm} 2.5 (median, 35; range, 22-36), while the MAT mean score was 12.0 {\textpm} 2.2 (median, 12; range, 6-15). Compared with family caregivers, direct support staff more frequently had undergone some medication training and had other people with whom they could discuss medication questions, but they had worked with the person with IDD a significantly shorter amount of time. No significant differences in STOFHLA and MAT scores between the family caregivers and direct support staff were observed. Caregiver education was significantly correlated with the STOFHLA score. MAT scores were not significantly correlated with caregiver characteristics. CONCLUSION: Caregivers are involved in the medication use process for people who have IDD. Ensuring caregiver understanding of medication regimens and/or improving medication-related HL may be an important step to ensure safe and effective use of medications by people with IDD.},

Objective The objectives were to measure the medication management hassles reported by caregivers of adults who have intellectual or developmental disabilities and to describe associations between characteristics of caregivers, medication regimens, and the person with intellectual or developmental disability and the scale score. Setting Web-based survey conducted in the United States. Method A newsletter announcement with a link to the survey was sent to members of a disability advocacy organization. Caregivers were age 18~years and older who manage medications for adults with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The survey questions were used to obtain characteristics of the caregiver, the medication regimen they managed, and the care-recipient. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Michigan Medicine (HUM00091002). Main outcome measure The Family Caregiver Medication Administration Hassles Scale (caregiver scale). Results Forty-two caregivers responded, with 41 being female with a mean age of 56.7~years. The mean caregiver scale score was 28.9 (possible range 0-120). Highest scores (greatest hassles) were significantly associated with a greater level of support required by the care-recipient, stronger caregiver beliefs of the necessity of medication and concern about using medications, lack of previous caregiver health-care training, and being an employed caregiver rather than family member. Conclusion Medication management can contribute to caregiver stress. Pharmacists should ensure that caregivers are counseled about medication that they manage, be accessible for questions, and examine medication regimens to reduce polypharmacy and complexity of regimens.},

Major medication quality indicators include polypharmacy, drug-drug interactions, and inappropriate medication use. To date, no study has attempted to evaluate the three approaches systematically or the effect of each approach on mortality in a Hispanic population. Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between polypharmacy, drug-drug interactions, and inappropriate medication use on the mortality of a community-based population of Mexican American older adults. METHODS: We used a life table survival analysis of a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of 3,050 older Mexican Americans of whom 1,823 were taking prescription and over-the-counter medications. RESULTS: After adjustment for relevant covariates, use of more than four different medications (polypharmacy) was independently associated with mortality. The presence of major drug interactions and the use of inappropriate medications were not significantly associated with mortality in our study sample. CONCLUSION: Polypharmacy ({$>$}4 medications) is significantly associated with mortality in Mexican American older adults. This community-based study is the first to demonstrate a direct association between polypharmacy and mortality in this population.},

  abstract = {From February 1999 to January 2000, a control programme to prevent the spread multi-resistant bacteria (MRB) was implemented in a French teaching hospital. This programme focused on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), and was based on the application of barrier precautions (washing hands with antiseptic soaps, wearing disposable gloves and gowns, identifying MRB carriers). No changes in antibiotic policy occurred during the year. Our aim was to conduct an evaluation of this programme by measuring incidence rates. Concurrently, the effect of barrier precautions was estimated in an indirect way, by documenting the availability of barrier precautions in MRB carriers' rooms and by analysing the monthly correlation between the supply of such material and the theoretical cumulated length of MRB carriers' isolation in six randomized wards. All MRB isolated in hospitalized patients were recorded, and differentiated between acquisition in our hospital or from elsewhere. For the analysis of trends, the year was divided in three periods of four months. Over the year, the global MRB incidence was 1.26 per 1000 patient-days (PD) [95\% confidence interval (95\%CI)=1.16-1.36]. The MRSA incidence was 0.89 per 1000 PD (95\%CI=0.81- 0.97) and the ESBL incidence was 0.38 per 1000 PD (95\% CI=0.33-0.43). The MRB incidence decreased significantly in all types of specialties except for surgical wards. The incidence decreased by 17.9\% for MRSA, 54.9\% for ESBL and 34.8\% for both MRB. Concurrently, the proportion of strains acquired in our hospital decreased for MRSA (P for trend {$>$} or = 0.05) and ESBL (P for trend {$>$} or = 0.01), whereas the incidence of imported strains increased slightly. The proportion of multiresistant strains in S. aureus (36.8\%) and Enterobacter aerogenes (37.0\%) remained similar throughout the year. Thus, the decrease of the incidence concerned both resistant and susceptible strains. The availability of antiseptic soaps increased significantly (P for trend {$>$} or = 0.01). The amount of antiseptic soap ordered and the theoretical lengths of isolation were correlated on a monthly basis (Spearman coefficient = 0.72; P {$>$} or = 0.02). These results shows the efficacy of such a programme of MRB containment in a large hospital, provided barrier nursing is instigated, together with the availability of such material as antiseptic soap, to allow implementation.},

  abstract = {Few biomarkers for sepsis diagnosis are commonly used in neonatal sepsis. While the role of host response is increasingly recognized in sepsis pathogenesis and  prognosis, there is a need for evaluating new biomarkers targeting host response  in regions where sepsis burden is high and medico-economic resources are scarce.  The objective of the study is to evaluate diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of  biomarkers of neonatal sepsis in Sub Saharan Africa. This prospective multicentre  study included newborn infants delivered in the Abomey-Calavi region in South  Benin and their follow-up from birth to 3~months of age. Accuracy of  transcriptional (CD74, CX3CR1), proteic (PCT, IL-6, IL-10, IP-10) biomarkers and  clinical characteristics to diagnose and prognose neonatal sepsis were measured.  At delivery, cord blood from all consecutive newborns were sampled and analysed,  and infants were followed for a 12~weeks' period. Five hundred and eighty-one  newborns were enrolled. One hundred and seventy-two newborns developed neonatal  sepsis (29.6\%) and death occurred in forty-nine infants (8.4\%). Although PCT,  IL-6 and IP-10 levels were independently associated with sepsis diagnosis,  diagnostic accuracy of clinical variables combinations was similar to  combinations with biomarkers and superior to biomarkers alone. Nonetheless, CD74,  being the only biomarkers independently associated with mortality, showed  elevated prognosis accuracy (AUC\,{$>$}\,0.9) either alone or in combination with other  biomarkers (eg. CD74/IP-10) or clinical criterion (eg. Apgar 1, birth weight).  These results suggest that cord blood PCT had a low accuracy for diagnosing early  onset neonatal sepsis in Sub Saharan African neonates, while association of  clinical criterion showed to be more accurate than any biomarkers taken  independently. At birth, CD74, either associated with IP-10 or clinical  criterion, had the best accuracy in prognosing sepsis mortality.Trial  registration Clinicaltrial.gov registration number: NCT03780712.

As data about early readmission in Italy are scarce, we aimed to relate the phenomenon of 30-day readmission to factors identified at the time of emergency department (ED) visits in subjects admitted to medical wards of a general hospital in Italy.MethodsWe performed a retrospective 30-month observational study, evaluating all patients admitted to the Department of Medicine of the Hospital of Ferrara, Italy. Our study compared early and late readmission: patients were evaluated on the basis of the ED admission diagnosis and classified differently on the basis of a concordant or discordant readmission diagnosis in respect to the diagnosis of a first hospitalization.ResultsOut of 13,237 patients admitted during the study period, 3,631 (27.4\%) were readmitted; of those, 656 were 30-day rehospitalizations (5\% of total admissions). Early rehospitalization occurred 12 days (median) later than previous discharge. The most frequent causes of rehospitalization were cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 29.3\% and pulmonary disease (PD) in 29.7\% of cases. Patients admitted with the same diagnosis were younger, had lower length of stay (LOS) and higher prevalence of CVD, PD and cancer. Age, CVD and PD were independently associated with 30-day readmission with concordant diagnosis and kidney disease with 30-day rehospitalization with a discordant diagnosis.ConclusionsComorbid patients are at higher risk for 30-day readmission. Reduction of LOS, especially in elderly subjects, could increase early rehospitalization rates.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) are known to affect several negative outcomes in older patients. However, studies comparatively assessing polypharmacy and PIMs in relation to readmission are distinctively lacking. AIMS: To compare the impact of polypharmacy and PIMs on 3-month readmission among older patients discharged from acute care hospital. METHODS: Our series consisted of 647 patients consecutively enrolled in a multicenter observational study. The outcome of the study was the occurrence of any admission during the 3-month follow-up after discharge. Polypharmacy was defined as use of more than eight medications. PIMs were identified using 2015 version of Beers and Screening Tool of Older Persons Prescriptions (STOPP) criteria. Statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, polypharmacy (OR 2.72, 95\% CI 1.48-4.99) was found associated with the outcome, while Beers (OR 0.85, 95\% CI 0.46-1.56), STOPP (OR 1.60, 95\% CI 0.85-3.01), or combined Beers and STOPP violations (OR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.57-1.74) were not. The association between polypharmacy and 3-month readmission was confirmed in logistic regression models including Beers (OR 2.88, 95\% CI 1.55-5.34), STOPP (OR 2.64, 95\% CI 1.43-4.87), or combined Beers and STOPP violations (OR 2.80, 95\% CI 1.51-5.21). DISCUSSION: Besides confirming that polypharmacy should be considered as a marker for readmission risk among older patients discharged from acute care hospital, our findings suggest that the association between polypharmacy and 3-month readmission is substantially independent of use of PIMs. CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy, but not PIMs was significantly associated with readmission. Hospitalization should always be considered as a clue to individuate unnecessary polypharmacy and to reduce the burden of medications whenever possible.},

There is no single diagnostic test that can fulfill all requirements  of the ideal biomarker yet. The current study enrolled 47 cases with EONS,  admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Units at Beni-Suef University teaching  Hospital from February 2017 to November 2017 and 37 apparently healthy controls.  All were subjected to routine laboratory tests and serum concentration of IL-27  and regulation on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were  measured. Significantly higher concentrations of IL-27 were observed in the  septic group while RANTES were significantly lower in comparison to the controls.  Moreover, there were no significant correlations between levels of IL-27 and  RANTES either in the septic or the control group. Sensitivity, specificity,  positive and negative predictive values for IL-27 were 93.6\%, 81.1\%, 86.3\% and  90.9, respectively while for RANTES such values were 68.1\%, 78.4\%, 80\% and 65.9\%,  respectively. A combination of both markers showed 97.3\% specificity for sepsis.  In conclusion, IL-27 is a useful and sensitive biomarker either individually or  combined with other candidate biomarkers like RANTES.},

Frail older people have increased risk of morbidity, institutionalization and death, resulting in burden to individuals, their families, health care services and society. Assessment and treatment of the frail individual provide many challenges to clinicians working with older people. Despite frailty being increasingly recognized in the literature, there is a paucity of direct evidence to guide interventions to reduce frailty. In this paper we review methods for identification of frailty in the clinical setting, propose a model for assessment of the frail older person and summarize the current best evidence for treating the frail older person. We provide an evidence-based framework that can be used to guide the diagnosis, assessment and treatment of frail older people.},

METHODS A cross sectional study among female STD clinic attendees in Orebro and a study among women called for Papanicolaou smear screening. Attendees were examined for urethritis and cervicitis. First void urine and endocervical samples were tested for M genitalium and C trachomatis. RESULTS The prevalence of C trachomatis and M genitalium in the STD clinic population was 10\% (45/465) and 6\% (26/461), respectively. Dual infection was diagnosed in four women. In the cancer screening group of women the corresponding prevalence was 2\% (1/59) and 0\%, respectively. Among the STD clinic attendees there were no significant differences in symptoms (32\% v 23\%, RR 1.4, 95\% CI 0.6 to 3.4) or signs (71\% v 50\%, RR 1.4, 95\% CI 0.9 to 2.3) between C trachomatis and M genitalium infections. Microscopic signs of cervicitis were significantly more common among M genitalium and C trachomatis infected women than in the cancer screening group of women. 56\% (15/27) of male partners of M genitalium infected women were infected with M genitalium compared to 59\% of male partners of C trachomatis infected women who were infected with C trachomatis (p = 0.80). CONCLUSIONS M genitalium is a common infection associated with cervicitis and with a high prevalence of infected sexual partners supporting its role as a cause of sexually transmitted infection.}

METHODS: A prospective, observational cohort study of a convenience sample of patients more than 64 years old was assessed using the TRST before discharge. The composite outcome of any emergency department (ED) revisit, hospital admission, or long-term care placement at 30 and 120 days was measured. Likelihood ratios (LRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. MAIN FINDINGS: Of 218 patients screened, 120 patients were enrolled. At 30 and 120 days, the positive LRs were 1.4 (95\% CI, 0.9-2.0) and 1.4 (95\% CI, 1.0-1.9), respectively. The negative LRs were 0.7 (95\% CI, 0.4-1.3) and 0.7 (95\% CI, 0.4-1.0), respectively. CONCLUSION: The TRST cannot be used as a single diagnostic test to predict whether Canadian ED elders will have an ED revisit, hospital admission, or long-term care placement at 30 or 120 days.},

We sought to investigate whether community-level health literacy estimates are associated with the initiation of oral antihyperglycemic agents (OHA) and the use of standard preventive care services among older adults with newly diagnosed diabetes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 169,758 patients, {$\geq$}65 years old with hypertension and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes using 2007-2011 data from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Chronic Conditions Warehouse. We examined the relationship between community-level health literacy estimates and initiation of OHA, receipt of flu shots, eye exams, Hemoglobin A1c tests, and lipid tests within 12 months post diabetes diagnosis. RESULTS: Patients living in communities with above basic health literacy (vs. basic/below basic) were 15\% more likely to initiate OHA (Hazard Ratio=1.15; 95\% CI 1.12 to 1.18). After classifying the health literacy distribution as quintiles, the analysis revealed a dose-response relationship with OHA initiation that plateaued at the third and fourth quintiles and declined at the fifth quintile. Individuals residing in communities with higher health literacy were more likely to participate in preventive care services (relative risk ranged from 1.09 for lipid test [95\% CI 1.07-1.11] to 1.43 for flu shot [95\% CI 1.41-1.46]). CONCLUSION: Community-level health literacy estimates were associated with the initiation of OHA and uptake of standard preventive care services in older adults. Community-level health literacy may help to inform targeted diabetes education and support efforts.},

OBJECTIVES: To describe South African (SA) prescribers' knowledge of, attitudes to and perceptions of ABR. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of knowledge of, attitudes to and perceptions of ABR among a convenience sample of primary healthcare providers in SA, the majority from the private sector. We used logistic regression to examine associations between knowledge and prescribing behaviours. RESULTS: Of 264 prescriber respondents, 95.8\% (230/240) believed that ABR is a significant problem in SA and 66.5\% (157/236) felt pressure from patients to prescribe antibiotics. The median knowledge score was 5/7, and scores were highest in respondents aged {$<$}55 years (p=0.0001). Prescribers with higher knowledge scores were more likely than those with lower scores to believe that to decrease ABR, narrow-spectrum antibiotics should be used (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.29, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1 - 1.65) and more likely to report that explaining disease features that should prompt follow-up was a useful alternative to prescribing (aOR 1.47, 95\% CI 1.058 - 2.04), and were less likely to report that antibiotics cannot harm the patient if they are not needed, so they prescribe when not necessary (aOR 0.57, 95\% CI 0.38 - 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: Prescribers of antibiotics in the private sector in SA were aware of the problem of ABR, but felt pressure from patients to prescribe. Those with higher knowledge scores reported positive prescribing behaviours, suggesting that more education is needed to tackle the problem of ABR.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study used the Disablement Process Model to predict whether a sample of the oldest-old maintained their disability or disability-free status over a 2- and 4-year follow-up, or whether they transitioned into a state of disability during this time. DESIGN AND METHODS: We followed a sample of 149 Swedish adults who were 86 years of age or older over a period of 4 years; we grouped them by ability in activities of daily living as being functional survivors (nondisabled over time), increasingly disabled (initially nondisabled but later disabled), chronically disabled (disabled at all waves), or deceased. We used variables from baseline to predict group membership into these four longitudinal outcome groups. RESULTS: Results indicated that demographic factors, physical impairments, physical and cognitive limitations, and psychosocial variables at baseline predicted membership into the functional survivor group after 2 years and most continued to distinguish between functional survivors and other groups after 4 years. IMPLICATIONS: These findings indicate key variables that may be useful in predicting shorter term longitudinal changes in disability. By understanding the physical, cognitive, and psychological variables that predict whether a person develops a disability within the next 2 or 4 years, we may be better able to plan for care or implement appropriate interventions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To understand factors leading to all-cause 30-day readmissions in a community hospital population. RESEARCH DESIGN: Structured case series of 537 readmissions using chart reviews, interviews with treating physicians, patients and family caregivers, and overall case assessment by a nurse-physician team. SETTING: Eighteen Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals. RESULTS: Forty-seven percent (250) of readmissions were assessed as potentially preventable; 11\% (55) were assessed as very or completely preventable; and 36\% (195) as slightly or moderately preventable. On average, 8.7 factors contributed to each potentially preventable readmission. Factors were related to care during the index stay (in 143 cases, 57\% of potentially preventable readmissions), the discharge process (168, 67\%), and follow-up care (197, 79\%). Missed opportunities to prevent readmissions were also related to quality improvement focus areas: transitions care planning and care coordination, clinical care, logistics of follow-up care, advance care planning and end-of-life care, and medication management. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors contributed to potentially preventable readmissions in an integrated health care system with low baseline readmission rates. Reducing all-cause 30-day readmissions may require a comprehensive approach addressing these areas. Future quality improvement efforts and research should identify existing and new tactics that can best prevent readmissions by addressing missed opportunities we identified.},

Results confirmed relatively high rates of disability in this age group, with 36\% of respondents having some basic ADL difficulty. Functional impairments (vision and grip strength) and functional limitations (upper and lower body limitations and cognition) were strongly related to disability, with functional limitations being a main driving force for disability. The role of psychosocial variables (depression, subjective health, and social integration) was explored through subsequent model testing. Results showed depression, subjective health, and social integration to potentially mediate the influence of risk factors, impairments, and limitations in the model.

System Dynamics is an intuitive modelling methodology based on qualitative reasoning, whereby a conceptual physiological model can be described as a set of cause--effect relationships between the physiological variables of a system, so that a set of dynamic equations describing the system behaviour quantitatively can be derived. Methods This paper presents system dynamics modelling methodology and its application for short-term arterial pressure control exerted through the baroreceptor reflex over a multi-compartmental cardiovascular model under the OpenModelica object-oriented simulation environment. Results The performance of the controlled system is analysed by simulation in light of the existing hypothesis and validation tests previously performed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the short-term regulation mechanism under physiological and pathological conditions. Conclusions The system dynamics can be viewed as a powerful and easy-to-use educational tool and useful in Health Sciences so as to explain the behaviour of a physiologic system under study.},

Design: A population-based registry study. Setting: Different health care settings in V{\"a}sternorrland county, Sweden. Subjects: All residents in the county at the end of 2006. Main outcome measures: The number of people per 1000 residents who had at least one appointment with a physician in an average month in different health care settings. Results: A total of 87 people had appointments with a physician in primary health care, 44 in outpatient clinics at a regional hospital, 20 in an emergency department, 14 in home care, and two in a university hospital outpatient clinic. Twelve were hospitalized at a regional hospital and {$<$}1 at the university hospital. Being young or elderly, female, divorced, widowed, and having a contractor as usual source of care were all independently associated with higher odds of receiving primary care. Conclusions: The physician's office in primary care is the setting that has the potential to affect the largest number of people. The extent of the use of health care was independently influenced by all sociodemographic characteristics studied, which highlights the importance of individual factors in future resource allocation. Regarding availability the ecology model provides superior information as compared with the absolute number of physicians' appointments. The prerequisites in Sweden of high-quality registries and unique personal identification numbers encourage future research on the ecology model to optimize accessibility of health care.},

METHODS Among non-insulin-treated diabetic patients aged 18-84years identified by multiple information sources, we assessed the measurement of glycated hemoglobin, microalbumin, and lipids through the year 2013. Patients' variables included gender, age, citizenship, and the attendance to Diabetes Clinics, while GP characteristics were gender, age and an attitude score derived from a questionnaire. The influence of patient and GP variables were investigated through multilevel regression with the execution of two HbA1c tests in 2013 as the outcome. RESULTS Out of 139,935 study subjects, more than 70\% had at least one HbA1c test in 2013; this percentage decreased to about 40\% for two HbA1c examinations. 67\% of patients had an assessment of lipid profile, while 45\% underwent a microalbumin test. These percentages were lower for immigrant patients and increased with age until the 65-74years age class. Patients attending Diabetes Clinics were usually better monitored than those who did not. In this latter group, female gender (risk ratio 1.08, 1.02-1.14), younger age (risk ratio 1.15, 1.06-1.25) and high attitude score of GPs (risk ratio 1.20, 1.13-1.27) were associated with a better management. CONCLUSIONS Both patient and GP variables influence the adherence to process of care indicators. The implementation of effective strategies of disease management at the primary care level may improve the control of glycemic and cardiovascular risk factors.},

The purpose of this initiative was to revise and update the Beers criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use in adults 65 years and older in the United States. METHODS: This study used a modified Delphi method, a set of procedures and methods for formulating a group judgment for a subject matter in which precise information is lacking. The criteria reviewed covered 2 types of statements: (1) medications or medication classes that should generally be avoided in persons 65 years or older because they are either ineffective or they pose unnecessarily high risk for older persons and a safer alternative is available and (2) medications that should not be used in older persons known to have specific medical conditions. RESULTS: This study identified 48 individual medications or classes of medications to avoid in older adults and their potential concerns and 20 diseases/conditions and medications to be avoided in older adults with these conditions. Of these potentially inappropriate drugs, 66 were considered by the panel to have adverse outcomes of high severity. CONCLUSIONS: This study is an important update of previously established criteria that have been widely used and cited. The application of the Beers criteria and other tools for identifying potentially inappropriate medication use will continue to enable providers to plan interventions for decreasing both drug-related costs and overall costs and thus minimize drug-related problems.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Among adults with Type 2 diabetes, low health literacy (HL) is a risk factor for negative health outcomes. Support from family and friends can improve adults' self-management and health-related outcomes. We examined whether supporters provided unique help to adults with diabetes and low HL and whether HL was associated with adults' perception of supporter helpfulness. METHODS: We used cross-sectional baseline survey data from 239 adult patients with diabetes enrolled in a randomized controlled trial with a support person. Patients reported level of supporter involvement with self-management roles. HL among patients and supporters was assessed using a validated HL screening tool. Patient perception of supporter helpfulness was assessed with a single item. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine associations of patient and supporter HL levels with supporter roles and patients' perception of supporter helpfulness. RESULTS: Patients with low HL were more likely to have a supporter with low HL (39\% vs. 26\%, p = .04). Patients with low HL had higher odds of receiving supporter help with calling health care providers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.09, 95\% CI [1.00, 4.39]), remembering medical appointments (AOR = 2.24, 95\% CI [1.07, 4.69]), and giving directions when blood sugars were low (AOR = 2.51, 95\% CI [1.20, 5.37]). Neither patient nor supporter HL was significantly associated with patients' perception of supporter helpfulness. DISCUSSION: Adults with diabetes and low HL reported more supporter involvement with specific self-management tasks than patients with adequate HL. Providers could consider targeted involvement of supporters to assist patients with chronic diseases and low HL, although they should be aware that supporters may be challenged by low HL.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Neonatal sepsis outreaches all causes of neonatal mortality worldwide and remains a major societal burden in low and middle income countries.  In addition to limited resources, endemic morbidities, such as malaria and  prematurity, predispose neonates and infants to invasive infection by altering  neonatal immune response to pathogens. Nevertheless, thoughtful epidemiological,  diagnostic and immunological evaluation of neonatal sepsis and the impact of  gestational malaria have never been performed. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A  prospective longitudinal multicentre follow-up of 580 infants from birth to  3\,months of age in urban and suburban Benin will be performed. At delivery, and  every other week, all children will be examined and clinically evaluated for  occurrence of sepsis. At delivery, cord blood systematic analysis of selected  plasma and transcriptomic biomarkers (procalcitonin, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10,  IP10, CD74 and CX3CR1) associated with sepsis pathophysiology will be evaluated  in all live births as well as during the follow-up, and when sepsis will be  suspected. In addition, whole blood response to selected innate stimuli and  extensive peripheral blood mononuclear cells phenotypic characterisation will be  performed. Reference intervals specific to sub-Saharan neonates will be  determined from this cohort and biomarkers performances for neonatal sepsis  diagnosis and prognosis tested.

  abstract = {Abstract Objective The objective of this study was to explore cross-country differences in spending and utilization across different domains of care for a multimorbid persona with heart failure and diabetes. Data Sources We used individual-level administrative claims or registry data from inpatient and outpatient health care sectors compiled by the International Collaborative on Costs, Outcomes, and Needs in Care (ICCONIC) across 11 countries: Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States (US). Data Collection/Extraction Methods Data collected by ICCONIC partners. Study Design We retrospectively analyzed age?sex standardized utilization and spending of an older person (65?90?years) hospitalized with a heart failure exacerbation and a secondary diagnosis of diabetes across five domains of care: hospital care, primary care, outpatient specialty care, post?acute rehabilitative care, and outpatient drugs. Principal Findings Sample sizes ranged from n~=~1270 in Spain to n~=~21,803 in the United States. Mean age (standard deviation [SD]) ranged from 76.2 (5.6) in the Netherlands to 80.3 (6.8) in Sweden. We observed substantial variation in spending and utilization across care settings. On average, England spent \$10,956 per person in hospital care while the United States spent \$30,877. The United States had a shorter length of stay over the year (18.9?days) compared to France (32.9) and Germany (33.4). The United States spent more days in facility-based rehabilitative care than other countries. Australia spent \$421 per person in primary care, while Spain (Aragon) spent \$1557. The United States and Canada had proportionately more visits to specialist providers than primary care providers. Across almost all sectors, the United States spent more than other countries, suggesting higher prices per unit. Conclusion Across 11 countries, there is substantial variation in health care spending and utilization for a complex multimorbid persona with heart failure and diabetes. Drivers of spending vary across countries, with the United States being the most expensive country due to high prices and higher use of facility-based rehabilitative care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Risk stratification algorithms (RSAs) can reduce antibiotic duration (AD) and length of stay (LOS) for early-onset sepsis (EOS).  Because of higher EOS and antibiotic resistance rates and limited laboratory  capacity, RSA implementation may benefit low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).  Our objective was to compare the impact of 4 RSAs on AD and LOS in an LMIC  nursery. METHODS: Neonates {$<$}5 days of age admitted for presumed sepsis to a  Kenyan referral hospital in 2019 (n = 262) were evaluated by using 4 RSAs,  including the current local sepsis protocol ("local RSA"), a simplified local  protocol ("simple RSA"), an existing categorical RSA that uses infant clinical  examination and maternal risk factors (CE-M RSA) clinical assessment, and the  World Health Organization's Integrated Management of Childhood Illness guideline.  For each RSA, a neonate was classified as at high, moderate, or low EOS risk. We  used {\cyrchar\cyrk} coefficients to evaluate the agreement between RSAs and McNemar's test for  the direction of disagreement. We used the Wilcoxon rank test for differences in  observed and predicted median AD and LOS. RESULTS: Local and simple RSAs  overestimated EOS risk compared with CE-M RSA and the Integrated Management of  Childhood Illness guideline. Compared with the observed value, CE-M RSA shortened  AD by 2 days and simple RSA lengthened AD by 2 days. LOS was shortened by 4 days  by using CE-M RSA and by 2 days by using the local RSA. CONCLUSIONS: The local  RSA overestimated EOS risk compared with CE-M RSA. If implemented fully, the  local RSA may reduce LOS. Future studies will evaluate the prospective use of  RSAs in LMICs with other interventions such as observation off antibiotics,  biomarkers, and bundled implementation.},

  abstract = {Weight discrimination has adverse effects on health that include increasing the risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes. Preliminary evidence suggests a positive association between weight discrimination and diagnosed diabetes; however, it is unknown whether psychosocial resources may buffer this association. In logistic regressions stratified by gender, we examined links between weight discrimination and diabetes among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project; N = 2.794 adults age 50 and older in 2015-16). We also tested the extent to which trait-resilience and social support from a spouse/partner, family, and friends buffered any observed association. We adjusted for known predictors of diabetes (age, race/ethnicity, Body Mass Index) and conducted sensitivity analyses restricted to men and women with obesity. Net of covariates, in the overall sample, weight discrimination was associated with significantly greater odds of having ever had diabetes among women (OR = 2.00, 95\% CI [1.15, 3.47]), but not men. Among women with obesity, weight discrimination was only significantly associated with greater odds of diabetes for those with low resilience (OR = 1.84, 95\% CI [1.01, 3.35]). Among men overall, weight discrimination was associated with lower odds of diabetes for those with high family support (OR = 0.03, 95\% CI [0.003, 0.25]) as well as those with high friend support (OR = 0.34, 95\% CI [0.13, 0.91]); similar effects were observed in men with obesity. These novel findings evince a role for psychosocial resources in buffering associations between weight discrimination and diabetes.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Hospital readmission rates are increasingly used for both quality improvement and cost control. However, the validity of readmission rates as a measure of quality of hospital care is not evident. We aimed to give an overview of the different methodological aspects in the definition and measurement of readmission rates that need to be considered when interpreting readmission rates as a reflection of quality of care. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review, using the bibliographic databases Embase, Medline OvidSP, Web-of-Science, Cochrane central and PubMed for the period of January 2001 to May 2013. Results: The search resulted in 102 included papers. We found that definition of the context in which readmissions are used as a quality indicator is crucial. This context includes the patient group and the specific aspects of care of which the quality is aimed to be assessed. Methodological flaws like unreliable data and insufficient case-mix correction may confound the comparison of readmission rates between hospitals. Another problem occurs when the basic distinction between planned and unplanned readmissions cannot be made. Finally, the multi-faceted nature of quality of care and the correlation between readmissions and other outcomes limit the indicator's validity. Conclusions: Although readmission rates are a promising quality indicator, several methodological concerns identified in this study need to be addressed, especially when the indicator is intended for accountability or pay for performance. We recommend investing resources in accurate data registration, improved indicator description, and bundling outcome measures to provide a more complete picture of hospital care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonates are at major risk of sepsis, but data on neonatal sepsis incidence are scarce. We aimed to assess the incidence and mortality of neonatal  sepsis worldwide. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. 13  databases were searched for the period January 1979-May 2019, updating the search  of a previous systematic review and extending it in order to increase data inputs  from low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We included studies on the  population-level neonatal sepsis incidence that used a clinical sepsis  definition, such as the 2005 consensus definition, or relevant ICD codes. We  performed a random-effects meta-analysis on neonatal sepsis incidence and  mortality, stratified according to sepsis onset, birth weight, prematurity, study  setting, WHO region and World Bank income level. RESULTS: The search yielded 4737  publications, of which 26 were included. They accounted for 2 797 879 live births  and 29 608 sepsis cases in 14 countries, most of which were middle-income  countries. Random-effects estimator for neonatal sepsis incidence in the overall  time frame was 2824 (95\% CI 1892 to 4194) cases per 100 000 live births, of which  an estimated 17.6\% 9 (95\% CI 10.3\% to 28.6\%) died. In the last decade  (2009-2018), the incidence was 3930 (95\% CI 1937 to 7812) per 100 000 live births  based on four studies from LMICs. In the overall time frame, estimated incidence  and mortality was higher in early-onset than late-onset neonatal sepsis cases.  There was substantial between-study heterogeneity in all analyses. Studies were  at moderate to high risk of bias. CONCLUSION: Neonatal sepsis is common and often  fatal. Its incidence remains unknown in most countries and existing studies show  marked heterogeneity, indicating the need to increase the number of  epidemiological studies, harmonise neonatal sepsis definitions and improve the  quality of research in this field. This can help to design and implement targeted  interventions, which are urgently needed to reduce the high incidence of neonatal  sepsis worldwide.},

Although many studies aiming to analyze the probable causes leading to unplanned readmissions have been performed, an in depth-study analyzing the human (healthcare worker)-, organizational-, technical-, disease- and patient-related causes leading to readmission is still missing. OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this study was to identify human-, organizational-, technical-, disease- and patient-related causes which contribute to acute readmission within 30days after discharge using a Root-Cause Analysis Tool called PRISMA-medical. The secondary objective was to evaluate how many of these readmissions were deemed potentially preventable, and to assess which factors contributed to these preventable readmissions in comparison to non-preventable readmissions. DESIGN Cross-sectional retrospective record study. SETTING An academic medical center in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS Fifty patients aged 18years and older discharged from an internal medicine department and acutely readmitted within 30days after discharge. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Root causes of preventable and unpreventable readmissions. RESULTS Most root causes for readmission were disease-related (46\%), followed by human (healthcare worker)- (33\%) and patient- (15\%) related root causes. Half of the readmissions studied were considered to be potentially preventable. Preventable readmissions predominantly had human-related (coordination) failures. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Our study suggests that improving human-related (coordinating) factors contributing to a readmission can potentially decrease the number of preventable readmissions.},

  abstract = {Background: Among heart failure (HF) patients, early readmission or death and repeat hospitalizations may be indicators of poor disease management or more severe disease. Methods and Results: We assessed the association of neighborhood median household income (nINC) and Medicaid status with rehospitalization or death in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort study (1987--2004) following an incident HF hospitalization in the context of individual socioeconomic status, and evaluated the relationship for modification by demographic and comorbid factors. We used generalized linear Poisson mixed models to estimate rehospitalization rate ratios and 95\% confidence intervals (RR, 95\% CI) and Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR, 95\% CI) of rehospitalization or death. In models controlling for race/study community, gender, age at HF diagnosis, body mass index, hypertension, educational attainment, alcohol use and smoking, persons with a high burden of comorbidity who were living in low nINC areas at baseline had an elevated hazard of all-cause rehospitalization (1.40, 1.10--1.77), death (1.36, 1.02--1.80), and rehospitalization or death (1.36, 1.08--1.70)---as well as increased rates of hospitalizations---compared to those with a high burden of comorbidity living in high nINC areas. Medicaid recipients with a low level of comorbidity had an increased hazard of all-cause rehospitalization (1.19, 1.05--1.36) and rehospitalization or death (1.21, 1.07--1.37), and a higher rate of repeat hospitalizations compared to non-Medicaid recipients. Conclusions: Comorbidity burden appears to influence the association between nINC, Medicaid status and rehospitalization and death among HF patients.},

  abstract = {Introduction The health benefits of marriage have been widely documented and, to a lesser extent, the effects of marital quality. Marital relationships may be particularly relevant to the health of older adults. This study explores the associations of marital status and marital quality with average glycemic levels in older adults using longitudinal data.Research design and methods Our sample consisted of adults aged 50--89 years without previously diagnosed diabetes from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (n=3335). We used biomarker data from waves 2 (2004/2005), 4 (2008/2009) and 6 (2012/2013) to analyze changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels within individuals in relation to their marital indicators (marital status, social support from spouse, and social strain from spouse) over time using linear fixed effect models.Results We found that being married was associated with lower HbA1c values ({$\beta$}: -0.21\%; 95\% CI -0.31\% to -0.10\%) among adults without pre-existing diabetes. Spousal support and spousal strain were generally not associated with HbA1c values.Conclusions It seems that marital relationships, regardless of the quality of the relationship, are associated with lower HbA1c values for male and female adults aged over 50 years.Data are available in a public, open access repository. ELSA data are available from the UK Data Service: https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-5050-24.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systolic hypertension increases the risk of dementia in elderly people. The vascular dementia project, set up in the framework of the double-blind placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) trial, investigated whether antihypertensive drug treatment could reduce the incidence of dementia. METHODS: Eligible patients had no dementia, were at least 60 years old, and had a blood pressure when seated of 160-219 mm Hg systolic and below 95 mm Hg diastolic. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) with the possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), or both drugs, titrated or combined to reduce the systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mm Hg to reach a value below 150 mm Hg. Cognitive function was assessed by the mini mental state examination (MMSE). If the MMSE score was 23 or less, diagnostic tests for dementia were done (DSM-III-R criteria). The cause of dementia was established by the modified ischaemic score with brain imaging or the Hachinski score. FINDINGS: Median follow-up by intention to treat was 2.0 years. Compared with placebo (n=1180), active treatment (n=1238) reduced the incidence of dementia by 50\% from 7.7 to 3.8 cases per 1000 patient-years (21 vs 11 patients, p=0.05). The median MMSE score at randomisation was 29 in both treatment groups. At the last available assessment, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were, respectively, 8.3 mm Hg and 3.8 mm Hg lower (p{$<$}0.001) in the active-treatment group, but on average the MMSE scores did not change in either group. In the control patients, however, the MMSE decreased (p=0.04) with decreasing diastolic blood pressure, whereas in the active-treatment group MMSE scores improved slightly (p=0.01) with greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure (p=0.002 for between-group difference). INTERPRETATION: In elderly people with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive treatment was associated with a lower incidence of dementia. If 1000 hypertensive patients were treated with antihypertensive drugs for 5 years 19 cases of dementia might be prevented.},

Development of patient-centred care of high-quality requires context-bound understanding of the multimorbid population's patterns of demographics, co-morbidities and medication use.The aim of this study was to identify patterns of multimorbidity in the total population of Region Stockholm, Sweden, by exploring demographics, claimed prescription drugs, risk of mortality and non-random association of conditions.In this cross-sectional descriptive population-based cohort study, we extracted data from the Swedish VAL database (N = 2 323 667) including all consultations in primary and specialized outpatient care, all inpatient care and all prescriptions claimed during 2017. We report number of chronic conditions and claimed prescription drugs, physical and mental co-morbidity, and 1-year mortality. We stratified the analyses by sex. We examined non-random associations between diseases using cluster analysis.In total, 21.6\% had multimorbidity (two or more chronic conditions) and 24.1\% had polypharmacy (more than five claimed prescription drugs). Number of claimed drugs, co-occurrence of mental and physical conditions, and 1-year mortality increased as multimorbidity increased. We identified seven multimorbidity clusters with clinically distinct characteristics. The smallest cluster (7\% of individuals) had prominent cardiovascular disease, the highest 1-year mortality rate, high levels of multimorbidity and polypharmacy, and was much older. The largest cluster (27\% of individuals) was younger and heterogenous, with primarily mental health problems.Individuals with chronic conditions often show clinical complexity with both concordant and discordant conditions and polypharmacy. This study indicates that clinical guidelines addressing clustering of conditions may be one strategy for managing complexity.},

Data were collected as part of a wider review commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England on the effectiveness of different actions to promote the mental wellbeing and independence of older people. All studies identified through this review were subject to a detailed critical appraisal of quality, looking at internal and external validity. Twenty-one papers covering evaluations of technological interventions were identified. They examined the psychosocial effects of technologies for education, exposure to, and/or training to use, computers and the internet, telephone/internet communication and computer gaming. Few studies took the form of randomized controlled trials, with little comparability in outcome measures, resulting in an inconsistent evidence base with moderate strength and quality. However, three out of six studies with high or moderate quality ratings (all focused on computer/internet training) reported statistically significant positive effects on psychosocial outcomes, including increased life satisfaction and experienced social support, as well as reduced depression levels among intervention recipients. The review results highlight the need for more methodologically rigorous studies evaluating the effects of technology-based interventions on mental wellbeing. Well-performed technology-based interventions to promote various aspects of mental wellbeing, as identified in this review, can serve as best practice examples in this emerging field.},

Patients may be vulnerable during this transition period. OBJECTIVE To describe the incidence, severity, preventability, and "ameliorability" of adverse events affecting patients after discharge from the hospital and to develop strategies for improving patient safety during this interval. DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING A tertiary care academic hospital. PATIENTS 400 consecutive patients discharged home from the general medical service. MEASUREMENTS The three main outcomes were adverse events, defined as injuries occurring as a result of medical management; preventable adverse events, defined as adverse events judged to have been caused by an error; and ameliorable adverse events, defined as adverse events whose severity could have been decreased. Posthospital course was determined by performing a medical record review and a structured telephone interview approximately 3 weeks after each patient's discharge. Outcomes were determined by independent physician reviews. RESULTS Seventy-six patients had adverse events after discharge (19\% [95\% CI, 15\% to 23\%]). Of these, 23 had preventable adverse events (6\% [CI, 4\% to 9\%]) and 24 had ameliorable adverse events (6\% [CI, 4\% to 9\%]). Three percent of injuries were serious laboratory abnormalities, 65\% were symptoms, 30\% were symptoms associated with a nonpermanent disability, and 3\% were permanent disabilities. Adverse drug events were the most common type of adverse event (66\% [CI, 55\% to 76\%]), followed by procedure-related injuries (17\% [CI, 8\% to 26\%]). Of the 25 adverse events resulting in at least a nonpermanent disability, 12 were preventable (48\% [CI, 28\% to 68\%]) and 6 were ameliorable (24\% [CI, 7\% to 41\%]). CONCLUSION Adverse events occurred frequently in the peridischarge period, and many could potentially have been prevented or ameliorated with simple strategies.},

Several studies have indicated that a substantial number of patients experience AEs before or during hospitalization. However, few data describe AEs after hospital discharge. We determined the incidence, severity, preventability and ameliorability of AEs in patients discharged from the general internal medicine service of a Canadian hospital. METHODS At a multisite Canadian teaching hospital, we prospectively studied patients who were consecutively discharged home or to a seniors' residence from the general internal medicine service during a 14-week interval in 2002. We used telephone interview and chart review to identify outcomes after discharge. Two physicians independently reviewed each outcome to determine if the patient experienced an AE. The severity, preventability and ameliorability of all AEs were classified. RESULTS During the study period, outcomes were determined for 328 of the 361 eligible patients, who averaged 71 years of age (interquartile range 54-81 years). After discharge, 76 of the 328 patients experienced at least 1 AE (overall incidence 23\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 19\%-28\%). The AE severity ranged from symptoms only (68\% of the AEs) or symptoms associated with a nonpermanent disability (25\%) to permanent disability (3\%) or death (3\%). The most common AEs were adverse drug events (72\%), therapeutic errors (16\%) and nosocomial infections (11\%). Of the 76 patients, 38 had an AE that was either preventable or ameliorable (overall incidence 12\%, 95\% CI 9\%-16\%). INTERPRETATION Approximately one-quarter of patients in our study had an AE after hospital discharge, and half of the AEs were preventable or ameliorable.},

This review aimed to assess the effect of bathing with 4\% chlorhexidine on the prevention of SSIs in clean surgeries compared with bathing with placebo solution or soap. METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for systematic reviews and the Cochrane manual were followed. Sources were MEDLINE and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature databases and manual search of references from evaluated studies. We included randomized studies evaluating clean surgical wounds and reporting SSIs after preoperative bathing with 4\% chlorhexidine. RESULTS: A total of 243 primary studies were identified and 8 were considered methodologically appropriate based on the Jadad Scale. Data were gathered from 10,655 patients. The global SSI rate was 7.2\%. The SSI rate for chlorhexidine bathing, placebo, and soap without antiseptic groups was 7.1\%, 9.1\%, and 5.1\%, respectively. A significant reduction in the infection rates was not found in the comparison between patients subjected to preoperative bathing with 4\% chlorhexidine versus placebo solution (relative risk, 0.91; 95\% confidence interval, 0.76-1.09). The same absence of benefit was observed comparing chlorhexidine bathing with soap (relative risk, 1.06; 95\% confidence interval, 0.68-1.66). CONCLUSIONS: Controlled clinical trials are needed to assess the effect of preoperative chlorhexidine bathing on infection rates following clean surgery before the incorporation of this intervention in health care services.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess early readmission as an indicator of quality of care, to estimate the frequency of avoidable emergency readmission in a French hospital, and then to describe the feasibility and contribution of routine use of this indicator. METHODS: A randomly selected sample of 469 readmissions within 30 days after a conventional hospitalization was chosen among the database of 40,242 hospitalizations during the first half of 1997. Two independent practitioners, whose true agreement was measured with a kappa test, studied the features of readmission recorded on the patient files, classing them as "unforeseeable" or "potentially avoidable". Database criteria that could automatically class the readmission in either group were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 119 unforeseeable readmissions (25.4\%). The two physicians agreed on the unforeseeable nature of 97 of these readmissions and 50 of them were judged avoidable. None of the database criteria allowed identifying all unforeseeable and avoidable readmissions. Readmission via the emergency unit was a sure indicator of unforeseeable readmission in 66\% of the cases and of avoidable readmissions in 60\%. The frequency of unforeseen readmissions was estimated at 3.9\% of all conventional stays during the first half of 1997. The frequency of avoidable readmissions was 1.5\%. CONCLUSIONS: Unforeseen early readmission can be an indicator of quality of the care taking process. It is however impossible to use the current database to classify with certainty readmissions as "unforeseeable" or "avoidable". Emergency unit readmission could offer a possible approach to measuring the frequency of unforeseen readmission. This ratio can provide caretakers with information concerning the quality of care and thus help in making decisions concerning reorganization for improvement.},

Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, and other risk factors was used to assess the relations of BP indexes to CHD risk over a 20-year follow-up. In the group {$<$}50 years of age, DBP was the strongest predictor of CHD risk (hazard ratio [HR] per 10 mm Hg increment, 1.34; 95\% CI, 1.18 to 1.51) rather than SBP (HR, 1.14; 95\% CI, 1.06 to 1.24) or PP (HR, 1.02; 95\% CI, 0.89 to 1.17). In the group 50 to 59 years of age, risks were comparable for all 3 BP indexes. In the older age group, the strongest predictor of CHD risk was PP (HR, 1.24; 95\% CI, 1.16 to 1.33). When both SBP and DBP were considered jointly, the former was directly and the latter was inversely related to CHD risk in the oldest age group CONCLUSIONS: With increasing age, there was a gradual shift from DBP to SBP and then to PP as predictors of CHD risk. In patients {$<$}50 years of age, DBP was the strongest predictor. Age 50 to 59 years was a transition period when all 3 BP indexes were comparable predictors, and from 60 years of age on, DBP was negatively related to CHD risk so that PP became superior to SBP.},

Participants All Danes aged {$\geq$}30 and born in Denmark after 1925, subdivided into subscribers and non-subscribers of mobile phones before 1995. Main outcome measures Risk of tumours of the central nervous system, identified from the complete Danish Cancer Register. Sex specific incidence rate ratios estimated with log linear Poisson regression models adjusted for age, calendar period, education, and disposable income. Results 358 403 subscription holders accrued 3.8 million person years. In the follow-up period 1990-2007, there were 10 729 cases of tumours of the central nervous system. The risk of such tumours was close to unity for both men and women. When restricted to individuals with the longest mobile phone use---that is, {$\geq$}13 years of subscription---the incidence rate ratio was 1.03 (95\% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.27) in men and 0.91 (0.41 to 2.04) in women. Among those with subscriptions of {$\geq$}10 years, ratios were 1.04 (0.85 to 1.26) in men and 1.04 (0.56 to 1.95) in women for glioma and 0.90 (0.57 to 1.42) in men and 0.93 (0.46 to 1.87) in women for meningioma. There was no indication of dose-response relation either by years since first subscription for a mobile phone or by anatomical location of the tumour---that is, in regions of the brain closest to where the handset is usually held to the head. Conclusions In this update of a large nationwide cohort study of mobile phone use, there were no increased risks of tumours of the central nervous system, providing little evidence for a causal association.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Hospitalizations for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (ACSCs) are seen as potentially avoidable with optimal primary care. Little is known, however, about how primary care physicians rate these hospitalizations and whether and how they could be avoided. This study explores the complex causality of such hospitalizations from the perspective of primary care physicians. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with 12 primary care physicians from 10 primary care clinics in Germany regarding 104 hospitalizations of 81 patients with ACSCs at high risk of rehospitalization. RESULTS: Participating physicians rated 43 (41\%) of the 104 hospitalizations to be potentially avoidable. During the interviews the cause of hospitalization fell into 5 principal categories: system related (eg, unavailability of ambulatory services), physician related (eg, suboptimal monitoring), medical (eg, medication side effects), patient related (eg, delayed help-seeking), and social (eg, lack of social support). Subcategories frequently associated with physicians' rating of hospitalizations for ACSCs as potentially avoidable were after-hours absence of the treating physician, failure to use ambulatory services, suboptimal monitoring, patients' fearfulness, cultural background and insufficient language skills of patients, medication errors, medication nonadherence, and overprotective caregivers. Comorbidities and medical emergencies were frequent causes attributed to ACSC-based hospitalizations that were rated as being unavoidable. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care physicians rated a significant proportion of hospitalizations for ACSCs to be potentially avoidable. Strategies to avoid these hospitalizations may target after-hours care, optimal use of ambulatory services, intensified monitoring of high-risk patients, and initiatives to improve patients' willingness and ability to seek timely help, as well as patients' medication adherence.},

This is especially the case with regard to medications that were newly prescribed during the hospital stay and are intended to be used after discharge or medications with an increased risk for adverse drug reactions (high-risk drugs). The aim of this study was to analyse the patients' level of knowledge about their discharge medication and to identify influence factors. METHODS: In a bicentric survey patients were interviewed prior to their discharge from an acute and a geriatric rehabilitation hospital. They were asked about their discharge medication in a structured interview. Influence factors were statistically analysed by Tobit regression. RESULTS: In total, 179 patients were interviewed. On average, patients named 48\% of their discharge medication correctly (95\% CI: 46-50\%). Influence factors for knowledge deficits were the lack of a medication plan, an older age, the hospitalization in a rehabilitation hospital and a long hospitalization. 81\% of the patients had at least one drug in their discharge medication, which was newly prescribed during the hospital stay. 11\% of those drugs were named correctly, the potency was named correctly in 6\%, the indication in 8\%. For almost two-thirds of the patients at least one high-risk drug was recommended in the discharge letter, among them most frequently oral anticoagulants and opioid analgesics. 38\% of these high-risk drugs were named correctly. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate an urgent need to train patients about their discharge medication, especially if medications are included that were newly prescribed during the hospital stay and recommended for further use after discharge or medications with an increased risk of adverse drug reactions. Particularly older patients and patients of a rehabilitation hospital after long hospitalization should be intensively counselled and obtain a medication plan upon discharge.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty is considered highly prevalent in old age and to confer high risk for falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality. Frailty has been considered synonymous with disability, comorbidity, and other characteristics, but it is recognized that it may have a biologic basis and be a distinct clinical syndrome. A standardized definition has not yet been established. METHODS: To develop and operationalize a phenotype of frailty in older adults and assess concurrent and predictive validity, the study used data from the Cardiovascular Health Study. Participants were 5,317 men and women 65 years and older (4,735 from an original cohort recruited in 1989-90 and 582 from an African American cohort recruited in 1992-93). Both cohorts received almost identical baseline evaluations and 7 and 4 years of follow-up, respectively, with annual examinations and surveillance for outcomes including incident disease, hospitalization, falls, disability, and mortality. RESULTS: Frailty was defined as a clinical syndrome in which three or more of the following criteria were present: unintentional weight loss (10 lbs in past year), self-reported exhaustion, weakness (grip strength), slow walking speed, and low physical activity. The overall prevalence of frailty in this community-dwelling population was 6.9\%; it increased with age and was greater in women than men. Four-year incidence was 7.2\%. Frailty was associated with being African American, having lower education and income, poorer health, and having higher rates of comorbid chronic diseases and disability. There was overlap, but not concordance, in the cooccurrence of frailty, comorbidity, and disability. This frailty phenotype was independently predictive (over 3 years) of incident falls, worsening mobility or ADL disability, hospitalization, and death, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.82 to 4.46, unadjusted, and 1.29-2.24, adjusted for a number of health, disease, and social characteristics predictive of 5-year mortality. Intermediate frailty status, as indicated by the presence of one or two criteria, showed intermediate risk of these outcomes as well as increased risk of becoming frail over 3-4 years of follow-up (odds ratios for incident frailty = 4.51 unadjusted and 2.63 adjusted for covariates, compared to those with no frailty criteria at baseline). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a potential standardized definition for frailty in community-dwelling older adults and offers concurrent and predictive validity for the definition. It also finds that there is an intermediate stage identifying those at high risk of frailty. Finally, it provides evidence that frailty is not synonymous with either comorbidity or disability, but comorbidity is an etiologic risk factor for, and disability is an outcome of, frailty. This provides a potential basis for clinical assessment for those who are frail or at risk, and for future research to develop interventions for frailty based on a standardized ascertainment of frailty.},

The purpose of this formative study was to explore the implications of applying Nutbeam's multidimensional health literacy framework to AA men's understanding of PrCA information. Participants were 25 AA men aged 45 and older in South Carolina. Their functional health literacy was assessed using two modified Cloze tests and the Shortened Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA). Men also participated in interviews or focus groups during which they were asked questions about PrCA risk, prevention, and screening. Transcripts were reviewed for recurrent themes and analyzed qualitatively using NVivo7. Mean S-TOFHLA was 28.28 (+/-1.98), implying "adequate" comprehension. Mean Cloze was .71 (+/-.05) for a Grade 8 document and .66 (+/-.04) for a Grade 13 document, also showing "adequate" comprehension. Cloze scores for the Grade 8 resource were lower for participants with less education (P = .047). Despite having satisfactory literacy test scores, results from interviews and focus groups revealed participants' limited understanding and misconceptions about PrCA risk. Many wanted information about screening and family history delivered word-of-mouth by AA women and church pastors as few of them had ever received or actively sought out PrCA resources. Using Nutbeam's framework, gaps in health literacy which were not adequately captured by the validated tools emerged during the interviews and focus groups. Study findings provide important implications for PrCA communication with AA men to correct misperceptions about cancer risk and motivate preventive behaviors.},

We aimed to investigate the relationship between health literacy and health behaviour (smoking, alcohol, physical activity, and diet) in people with diabetes. Methods. The study was based on respondents aged 25 years or older from a population-based survey in 2013 who reported having diabetes (n = 1685). Two dimensions from the Health Literacy Questionnaire were used: "understand health information" and "actively engage with healthcare providers." We used logistic regression to examine the association between health literacy and health behaviour. Results. After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, individuals with diabetes who found it difficult to understand information about health had higher odds of being physically inactive (OR: 3.43, 95\% CI: 2.14-5.51) and having unhealthy dietary habits (OR: 3.01, 95\% CI: 1.63-5.58). Similar results were observed for individuals who found it difficult to actively engage with healthcare providers. No associations were found between the two dimensions of health literacy and smoking and alcohol consumption. Conclusion. When developing health services and interventions to improve health behaviour among people with diabetes, our results suggest that they may benefit by including focus on health literacy.},

  abstract = {When the antecedents of health-promoting behavior are explored, the concept of health literacy is deemed a factor of major influence. Originally defined as reading, writing and numeracy skills in the health domain, health literacy is now considered a multidimensional concept. The ongoing discussion on health literacy reveals that no agreement exists about which dimensions to include in the concept. To contribute to the development of a consistent and parsimonious concept of health literacy, we conducted a critical review of concepts in other literacy domains. Our review was guided by two research questions: (i) Which dimensions are included in the concepts of other literacy domains? (ii) How can health literacy research profit from other literacy domains? Based on articles collected from PubMed, PsycINFO, Communication \& Mass Media Complete, CINAHL, SAGE Full-Text Collection, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar as well as selected monographs and editions, we identified seven distinct dimensions. Some of the dimensions recur across all reviewed literacy domains and first attempts have been made to operationalize the dimensions. Expanding upon these dimensions, the paper discusses how they can prove useful for elaborating a consistent and parsimonious concept of health literacy and foster the development of a more holistic measure.},

Two large population-based surveys in rural China were carried out from July 2011 to April 2012. Data used in this study were second hand and sorted out from the two previous databases. A binary logistic regression analysis was employed to discover the impact of demographic characteristics, level of health literacy, and other factors on respondents' health information sharing behavior. Among the total 1,324 participants, 63.6\% share health information with others. Among all significant predictors, those who acquire health information via family and friends are 6.0 times the odds of sharing health information than those who do not. Participants who have more than six household members, with middle and high levels of health knowledge, and who are moderately involved in discussions or settlements of village affairs are also more likely to share health information. The reliance on interpersonal communication channels for health information, household size, the patients' preexisting health knowledge, and their activity in village affairs are crucial determinants for health information sharing among rural chronic patients. A more sophisticated model needs to be established to reveal the complex processes of health information communication.},

The main findings are that, with marginal exceptions, life satisfaction is gender independent, while age is systematically and positively associated with vocational and financial situations. Having no partner and being a first-generation immigrant implies for most LiSat-11 items a relatively low level of satisfaction. Factor analysis of the domain-specific items yields a gender-independent four-factor structure, which is robustly independent of different scaling reductions. Gross levels of satisfaction (dichotomized scales 1-4 vs 5-6) of seven domains were significant classifiers (odds ratio 1.7-3.9) of gross level of satisfaction with life as a whole. This investigation provides reference values for LiSat-11, which, with its ease of administration may be an adequate instrument for analysing, in terms of subjects' cognitive appraisal of emotions, aspirations-achievement gaps.},

In this work we describe and compare several predictive models, some of which have never been applied to this task and which outperform the regression methods that are typically applied in the healthcare literature. In addition, we apply methods from deep learning to the five conditions CMS is using to penalize hospitals, and offer a simple framework for determining which conditions are most cost effective to target.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a blood stream infection which is seen in the first month of life of the neonate. Bacterial profile of neonatal septicemia is  constantly changing thus, current knowledge on the patterns of bacterial  isolates, its antibiotic resistance profile, and associated factors, are  essential to design and implement appropriate interventions. Therefore, the aim  of this study was to identify bacterial etiologic agents, their antimicrobial  susceptibility pattern and associated risk factors of neonatal sepsis among  neonates. METHODS: A cross- sectional study was conducted among neonates  suspected to sepsis attending University of Gondar Hospital from September/2015  to May/2016. A total of 251 consecutive neonates with clinical sign and symptoms  of sepsis were included in the study. Blood sample was collected and directly  inoculated into Trypton soya broth bottle and incubated at 37~{$^\circ$}C. After 24~h of  incubation it was sub- cultured in to blood agar plate, chocolate agar plate,  manitol salt agar and Macconkey. The bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial  susceptibility tests were identified using standard microbiological methods.  Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify possible  associated risk factors. Prior to the study ethical clearance was obtained from  the School of Biomedical and Laboratory Sciences, University of Gondar. RESULTS:  Of the 251 study participants suspected of neonatal sepsis, 117 (46.6\%) showed  bacterial growths, of them 120 bacteria were isolated. Gram positive bacteria  were commonly isolated 81 (67.5\%).The commonly isolated bacterial species were S.  aureus 49 (40.8\%) followed by coagulase negative Staphylococci 26 (21.6\%) and K.  pneumoniae19 (15.8\%). The overall rate of multidrug resistance isolates was 78  (65\%: CI 95\%: 56.7-72.5\%). Multidrug resistant (MDR) among Gram positive and  negative bacteria were 56 (69.1\%) and 22 (56.4\%), respectively. Independent risk  factors for the occurrence of neonatal sepsis were; Apgar score~{$<~$}7/5~min  (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR] =0.5), birth weight~{$<~$}1.5~kg (AOR~=~12.37), birth  weight, 1.5-2.5~kg (AOR~=~2.6), gestational week {$<$}37~weeks (AOR~=~9) and  caesarian section delivery (AOR~=~5.2). CONCLUSION: The isolation rate of  bacterial pathogens in neonatal sepsis was considerably high. In addition, nearly  70\% of isolates were MDR strains. Low birth weight, low Apgar score, preterm  delivery and caesarian section modes of delivery were associated risk factors.  Therefore, appropriate antenatal care follow up, and health education should be  encouraged, especially on the importance of natural way of delivery.},

  abstract = {Background: falls are a major cause of disability and death in older people. Women are more likely to fall than men, but little is known about whether risk factors for falls differ between the sexes. We used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing to investigate the prevalence of falls by sex and to examine cross-sectionally sex-specific associations between a range of potential risk factors and likelihood of falling. Methods: participants were 4,301 men and women aged 60 and over who had taken part in the 2012--13 survey of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. They provided information about sociodemographic, lifestyle and behavioural and medical factors, had their physical and cognitive function assessed and responded to a question about whether they had fallen down in the last two years. Results: in multivariable logistic regression models, severe pain and diagnosis of at least one chronic disease were independently associated with falls in both sexes. Sex-specific risk factors were incontinence (odds ratio (OR), 1.48; 95\% CI, 1.19, 1.85) and frailty (OR 1.69, 95\% CI 1.06, 2.69) in women, and older age (OR 1.02, 95\% CI 1.04, 1.07), high levels of depressive symptoms (OR 1.33, 95\% CI 1.05, 1.68), and being unable to perform a standing balance test (OR 3.32, 95\% CI 2.09, 5.29) in men. Conclusion: although we found some homogeneity between the sexes in the risk factors that were associated with falls, the existence of several sex-specific risk factors suggests that gender should be taken into account in designing fall-prevention strategies.},

To test the effectiveness of the FN, 110 of 147 Latino CGs, who were randomly assigned to the Fotonovela Condition (FNC) or the Usual Information Condition (UIC), were included in the final analyses. Self-report measures were given at baseline and post intervention. Results showed that FNC CGs demonstrated significantly greater reductions in level of depressive symptoms than UIC CGs. A significant decrease in level of stress due to memory and behavioral problems exhibited by their loved ones was similar in both groups. The FNC CGs reported that the FN was more helpful and that they referred to it more often than the UIC CGs did with regard to the informational materials they were provided about dementia. In conclusion, a culturally tailored FN can be an effective tool for Latino CGs given their high unmet needs for assistance and various barriers in accessing resources.},

  abstract = {WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Adults who support an adult family member with a severe and enduring mental health problem often experience carer burden. Over time, this often negatively affects their mental and physical health and social well-being. Understanding and communicating about mental health problems in families can help to improve resilience and coping among both adults and children. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: We conducted a review of studies looking at how adult relatives understand and communicate about an adult family member's mental health problem. The findings highlight that how relatives make sense of MHP is related to historical family relationships, their mental health literacy and whether they see themselves as a "carer" or not. The findings also show that little research to date has explored how adult relatives talk with children about their parent's difficulties, and how the adults' understanding might affect what children learn about the MHP. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: There is a research gap to be addressed regarding family communication with children about parental mental health problems. This knowledge gap likely impacts family-focused mental health nursing and therapy provision. Mental health nursing, therapeutic and support workers and advocates are ideally positioned to assist relatives with improving their mental health literacy and confidence communicating about mental health, and to promote inclusion of relatives and children in interventions. ABSTRACT: Introduction Relatives are profoundly affected by an adult family member's severe and enduring mental health problem (MHP). The burdens of caring impact on adult relatives' emotional, physical and social well-being. How relatives make meaning and communicate about the MHP is thought to affect family talk about mental health, and this can impact family coping and well-being. Aim No review has yet drawn together research about how adult relatives of people with severe and enduring MHP make meaning and communicate about their relatives' difficulties. We aimed to address this gap. Method We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed primary research. SCOPUS, PubMed, Psychnet, SCIE, Cochrane and CINAHL+ databases were searched. Results Nineteen papers qualified for inclusion. Findings are organized under four themes: making meaning about the MHP and affected individual; conceptualizing the self in the presence of the MHP; meaning-making processes underlying relatives' well-being outcomes; and relatives' perspectives on family talk about the MHP. Discussion Historical relationships, caregiver identity and mental health literacy moderate relatives' understanding and talk about the MHP. Implications for practice Psychoeducation and communication support for relatives should be provided by mental health practitioners. Future research should address familial communication about MHP, including with children.},

Setting Population-based cohort randomly selected from the voter registration lists. Participants Individuals aged 65+ (N=1066). Measurements The Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA); demographics; self-rated health; number of prescription drugs; modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies- Depression scale; Mini-Mental State Examination; Wechsler Test of Adult Reading; Clinical Dementia Rating; cognitive domain composite scores; independence in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and medication management; health services utilization (emergency/urgent care visits and hospitalizations). Results Low (inadequate or marginal) S-TOFHLA scores were obtained by 7.04\% of the sample. In unadjusted analyses, participants with low S-TOFHLA scores were significantly more likely than those with higher scores to be older, male, non-White, with lesser education and lower household income, to have lower scores on the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and all cognitive domains; to be more dependent in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and be taking more prescription drugs. In a multiple regression model including all covariates, only older age, male sex, and lower reading level were independently associated with inadequate or marginal S-TOFHLA scores. Conclusion In a population-based sample of older adults, low functional health literacy was associated with age, sex, education, and reading ability. Basic functional health literacy is essential for understanding health information and instructions. Clinicians should formally or informally assess health literacy in their older patients to ensure effective communication and enhance health outcomes.},

METHODS Men and women with urethral discharge or dysuria and vaginal discharge were enrolled at 12 central and 52 smaller pharmacies in Lima, Peru. All participants answered a questionnaire. Men provided urine for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, and for leucocyte esterase testing. Women provided self-obtained vaginal swabs for PCR testing for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis culture and bacterial vaginosis and Candida. RESULTS Among 106 symptomatic men, N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis were detected in 34\% and were associated with urethral discharge compared with dysuria only (odds ratio (OR) 4.3, p = 0.003), positive urine leucocyte esterase testing (OR 7.4, p = 0.009), less education (OR 5.5, p = 0.03), and with symptoms for {$<$}5 days (OR 2.5, p = 0.03). Among 121 symptomatic women, 39\% had bacterial vaginosis or T vaginalis, and 7.7\% had candidiasis. N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis were detected in 12.4\% of the women. Overall, 48.8\% had one or more of these infections. No factors were associated with vaginal infection, and only symptoms of vaginal discharge for {$<$}5 days were associated with N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis (OR 4.0, p = 0.02). The main reason reported for seeking advice at pharmacies by both men and women was trust in pharmacy workers. CONCLUSIONS Among men and women presenting to pharmacies with urethral and vaginal symptoms, rates of urethral and vaginal infections were comparable to those found in other clinical settings. Pharmacies can contribute to the care and prevention of sexually transmitted infection in developing countries.},

The authors examined the association of health literacy levels between older Hispanic patients and their caregivers among 174 patient-caregiver dyads enrolled from 3 community clinics and 28 senior centers in San Antonio, Texas. Health literacy was measured using English and Spanish versions of the Short-Test of Functional Health Literacy Assessment and categorized as "low" or "adequate." The largest dyad category (41\%) consisted of a caregiver with adequate health literacy and patient with low health literacy. Among the dyads with the same health literacy levels, 28\% had adequate health literacy and 24\% had low health literacy. It is notable that 7\% of dyads consisted of a caregiver with low health literacy and a patient with adequate health literacy. Low health literacy is a concern not only for older Hispanic patients but also for their caregivers. To provide optimal care, clinicians must ensure that information is given to both patients and their caregivers in clear effective ways as it may significantly affect patient health outcomes.},

Twenty indicators are analysed related to health, the use of healthcare services and consumption of prescription drugs. Rates, frequencies and averages are obtained for the different variables stratified by age groups (under 15 years, 15--64 years and 65 years or older), gender and socioeconomic status (calculated on the basis of pharmacy copayment levels and Social Security benefits received).Results A socioeconomic gradient was observed in all the indicators analysed, in both sexes and in all age groups. Morbidity, use of mental healthcare centres, hospitalisation rates and probability of drug consumption among children is 3--7 times higher for those with low socioeconomic level respect to those with a higher one. In children and adults, the steepest gradient was found in the use of mental health services. Moreover, there are gender inequalities.Conclusion There are significant socioeconomic inequalities in health status and in the use of healthcare services in the population of Catalonia. To respond to this situation, new policies on health and other areas, such as education and employment, are required, especially those that have an impact on early years.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poorly-executed transitions out of the hospital contribute significant costs to the healthcare system. Several evidence-based interventions can reduce post-discharge utilization. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost avoidance associated with implementation of the Care Transitions Intervention (CTI). DESIGN: A quasi-experimental cohort study using consecutive convenience sampling. PATIENTS: Fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized from 1 January 2009 to 31 May 2011 in six Rhode Island hospitals. INTERVENTION: The CTI is a patient-centered coaching intervention to empower individuals to better manage their health. It begins in-hospital and continues for 30 days, including one home visit and one to two phone calls. MAIN MEASURES: We examined post-discharge total utilization and costs for patients who received coaching (intervention group), who declined or were lost to follow-up (internal control group), and who were eligible, but not approached (external control group), using propensity score matching to control for baseline differences. KEY RESULTS: Compared to matched internal controls (N\,=\,321), the intervention group had significantly lower utilization in the 6 months after discharge and lower mean total health care costs (\$14,729 vs. \$18,779, P\,=\,0.03). The cost avoided per patient receiving the intervention was \$3,752, compared to internal controls. Results for the external control group were similar. Shifting of costs to other utilization types was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates that the CTI generates meaningful cost avoidance for at least 6 months post-hospitalization, and also provides useful metrics to evaluate the impact and cost avoidance of hospital readmission reduction programs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The burden of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in low-income countries is alarming. This study aimed to identify the bacterial etiologies and  antibiotic resistance patterns among neonates in Jimma, Ethiopia. METHODS: An  observational longitudinal study was conducted among 238 presumptive neonatal  sepsis cases tested with blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid culture. The bacterial  etiologies were confirmed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time  of flight mass spectrometry. The antibiotic resistance patterns were determined  using the automated disc diffusion method (Bio-Rad) and the results were  interpreted based on the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility  Testing 2021 breakpoints. Extended-spectrum {$\beta$}-lactamases were detected using a  double disc synergy test and confirmed by Mast discs (Mast Diagnostica GmbH).  RESULTS: A total of 152 pathogens were identified. Of these, Staphylococcus  aureus (18.4\%) was the predominant isolate followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae  (15.1\%) and Escherichia coli (10.5\%). All the isolates exhibited a high rate of  resistance to first- and second-line antibiotics ranging from 73.3\% for  gentamicin to 93.3\% for ampicillin. Furthermore, 74.4\% of the Gram-negative  isolates were extended-spectrum {$\beta$}-lactamase producers and 57.1\% of S. aureus  strains were methicillin resistant. The case fatality rate was 10.1\% and 66.7\% of  the deaths were attributable to infections by multidrug-resistant pathogens.  CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed a high rate of infections with  multidrug-resistant pathogens. This poses a significant challenge to the current  global and national target to reduce neonatal mortality rates. To address these  challenges, it is important to employ robust infection prevention practices and  continuous antibiotic resistance testing to allow targeted therapy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of unplanned readmissions in Geriatric Medicine in Aberdeen and to examine their nature in order to establish how many of them were avoidable. DESIGN: Patients living within Aberdeen who were discharged from Care of the Elderly Assessment Wards in one hospital between 1 August 1994 and 31 January 1995 were identified. Any subsequent unplanned readmissions of this population to any local hospital within 28 days were identified and formed the study's sample. Subsequent comparison with the non-readmitted population yielded readmission rates. The nature of each episode was investigated by obtaining a wide range of data (e.g. from medical and nursing notes) soon after readmission and by the audit team subsequently identifying principal and associated causative factors. A questionnaire was also sent to the discharging consultant and the patient's GP seeking opinions on whether readmission was avoidable and these were weighted equally with the audit team's opinion in order to establish avoidability. SETTING: The patients were all discharged from the nine Care of the Elderly Assessment wards at Woodend Hospital in Aberdeen and readmitted to any NHS hospital within Aberdeen. SUBJECTS: The subjects were patients living within Aberdeen who satisfied the above criteria. RESULTS: There were 109 episodes of readmission resulting from 713 discharges, making a readmission rate of 15.3\%. The readmitted population was elderly with multiple medical problems; 50\% lived alone. In 87\% of cases the principal causative factor in readmission was medical, most commonly involving relapse of illness. The remaining 13\% were 'social' in nature. Response rates to the questionnaire by GP's and Consultants were excellent (96\% and 99\% respectively) and 34 cases emerged where either party, or both, thought readmission to be avoidable. These cases were subject to further review by the audit team and in this way 16 of the 34 cases were judged to be avoidable. The main area for improvement was considered to be pre-discharge assessment of home circumstances. CONCLUSION: The majority of unplanned readmissions were medical in nature and unavoidable. The use of rates of unplanned readmission as a measure of clinical outcome in care of the elderly is unsatisfactory as they do not accurately reflect the quality of in-patient care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Potential role of health literacy in determining adherence to COVID-19 preventive behavior, pharmacological, and lifestyle management among diagnosed patients of chronic diseases during nationwide lockdown is inadequately investigated. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May-August 2020 among diagnosed patients of chronic diseases residing in a COVID-19 hotspot of urban Jodhpur, Rajasthan, and availing health services from primary care facility. Telephonic interviews of participants were conducted to determine their health literacy using HLS-EU-Q47 questionnaire, adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviour as per World Health Organization recommendations, and compliance to prescribed pharmacological and physical activity recommendations for chronic disease. RESULTS: All the 605 diagnosed patients of chronic diseases availing services from primary care facility were contacted for the study, yielding response rate of 68\% with 412 agreeing to participate. Insufficient health literacy was observed for 65.8\% participants. Only about half of participants had scored above median for COVID-19 awareness (55.1\%) and preventive behavior (45.1\%). Health literacy was observed to be significant predictor of COVID-19 awareness [aOR: 3.53 (95\% CI: 1.81-6.88)]; COVID-19 preventive behavior [aOR: 2.06, 95\%CI; 1.14-3.69] and compliance to pharmacological management [aOR: 3.05; 95\% CI: 1.47-6.35] but not for physical activity. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 awareness, preventive behavior, and compliance to pharmacological management is associated with health literacy among patients of chronic disease availing services from primary health facility. Focusing on health literacy could thus be an essential strategic intervention yielding long term benefits.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of low functional health literacy among community-dwelling Medicare enrollees in a national managed care organization. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Four Prudential HealthCare plans (Cleveland, Ohio; Houston, Tex; south Florida; Tampa, Fla). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3260 new Medicare enrollees aged 65 years or older were interviewed in person between June and December 1997 (853 in Cleveland, 498 in Houston, 975 in south Florida, 934 in Tampa); 2956 spoke English and 304 spoke Spanish as their native language. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE; Functional health literacy as measured by the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. RESULTS: Overall, 33.9\% of English-speaking and 53.9\% of Spanish-speaking respondents had inadequate or marginal health literacy. The prevalence of inadequate or marginal functional health literacy among English speakers ranged from 26.8\% to 44.0\%. In multivariate analysis, study location, race/language, age, years of school completed, occupation, and cognitive impairment were significantly associated with inadequate or marginal literacy. Reading ability declined dramatically with age, even after adjusting for years of school completed and cognitive impairment. The adjusted odds ratio for having inadequate or marginal health literacy was 8.62 (95\% confidence interval, 5.55-13.38) for enrollees aged 85 years or older compared with individuals aged 65 to 69 years. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly managed care enrollees may not have the literacy skills necessary to function adequately in the health care environment. Low health literacy may impair elderly patients' understanding of health messages and limit their ability to care for their medical problems.},

We sought to determine whether older adults with inadequate health literacy were more likely to report depressive symptoms and whether health literacy was an independent predictor of depression symptomatology. METHODS: A total of 3260 new Medicare enrollees 65 years or older were interviewed in person between June and December 1997 from 4 managed care plans (853 in Cleveland, Ohio, 498 in Houston, Tex, 975 in South Florida, and 934 in Tampa, Fla). Depression symptoms were measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale. RESULTS: Overall, 13\% of respondents were classified as depressed. Individuals with inadequate health literacy had 2.7 times the odds (95\% confidence interval, 2.2-3.4) of being depressed compared with individuals with adequate health literacy skills. However, after controlling for health status with multiple logistic regression, individuals with inadequate health literacy were not more likely to be depressed (adjusted odds ratio, 1.2; 95\% confidence interval, 0.9-1.7). Individuals who had less social support, exercised less than twice a week, drank alcohol heavily, or had poor health status (at least 3 health conditions, physical limitations, or fair or poor self-rated health) had significantly higher odds of depression symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: Although individuals with inadequate health literacy were more than twice as likely to report depressive symptoms, this was mostly explained by their worse health status. The strong relation between depression symptoms and poor health status suggests the need to research interventions to improve mental and physical health concurrently. The influence of particular interventions on depression, such as referral to community support contacts and recommendations for an exercise program, needs to be further evaluated.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease. By providing national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years, this study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in context. METHODS: We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and trends in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2015. This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met World Cancer Research Fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable evidence. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. We developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure across risk factors-the summary exposure value. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We decomposed trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth, population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific DALY rates. We characterised risk exposure in relation to a Socio-demographic Index (SDI). FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation, household air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and smoking each decreased by more than 25\%. Global exposure for several occupational risks, high body-mass index (BMI), and drug use increased by more than 25\% over the same period. All risks jointly evaluated in 2015 accounted for 57{$\cdot$}8\% (95\% CI 56{$\cdot$}6-58{$\cdot$}8) of global deaths and 41{$\cdot$}2\% (39{$\cdot$}8-42{$\cdot$}8) of DALYs. In 2015, the ten largest contributors to global DALYs among Level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure (211{$\cdot$}8 million [192{$\cdot$}7 million to 231{$\cdot$}1 million] global DALYs), smoking (148{$\cdot$}6 million [134{$\cdot$}2 million to 163{$\cdot$}1 million]), high fasting plasma glucose (143{$\cdot$}1 million [125{$\cdot$}1 million to 163{$\cdot$}5 million]), high BMI (120{$\cdot$}1 million [83{$\cdot$}8 million to 158{$\cdot$}4 million]), childhood undernutrition (113{$\cdot$}3 million [103{$\cdot$}9 million to 123{$\cdot$}4 million]), ambient particulate matter (103{$\cdot$}1 million [90{$\cdot$}8 million to 115{$\cdot$}1 million]), high total cholesterol (88{$\cdot$}7 million [74{$\cdot$}6 million to 105{$\cdot$}7 million]), household air pollution (85{$\cdot$}6 million [66{$\cdot$}7 million to 106{$\cdot$}1 million]), alcohol use (85{$\cdot$}0 million [77{$\cdot$}2 million to 93{$\cdot$}0 million]), and diets high in sodium (83{$\cdot$}0 million [49{$\cdot$}3 million to 127{$\cdot$}5 million]). From 1990 to 2015, attributable DALYs declined for micronutrient deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation and water, and household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted DALY rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. Rising exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable DALYs from high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational carcinogens, and drug use. Environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined steadily with SDI; low physical activity, high BMI, and high fasting plasma glucose increased with SDI. In 119 countries, metabolic risks, such as high BMI and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most attributable DALYs in 2015. Regionally, smoking still ranked among the leading five risk factors for attributable DALYs in 109 countries; childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early death and disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa. INTERPRETATION: Declines in some key environmental risks have contributed to declines in critical infectious diseases. Some risks appear to be invariant to SDI. Increasing risks, including high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, drug use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities for intervention. Some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain major causes of attributable DALYs, even as exposure is declining. Public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are increasingly major contributors to global burden. FUNDING: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, particularly in the developing countries. Delays in the identification  and treatment of neonatal sepsis are among the main contributors to the high  mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors of neonatal  sepsis in public hospitals of Mekelle City, Tigray Region, North Ethiopia, 2015.  METHODS: A hospital based case control study was done in public hospitals of  Mekelle City, Tigray region. Cases were neonates who had sepsis with their index  mothers and controls were neonates who hadn't had sepsis with their index  mothers. Hematologic findings were used to diagnose sepsis once the neonates were  being clinically suspected. Cases and controls were selected using the systematic  sampling technique. Data were entered using Epi info version 7 and then analyzed  using SPSS window 20. The binary logistic regression model was used to test the  association between dependent and independent variables and multivariable  logistic regression was used to identify the associated risk factors to neonatal  sepsis. FINDINGS: A total of 78 cases and 156 controls were included in this  study. More than three quarters (76.8\%) of cases had early onset sepsis. The  multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the possible risk factors  of neonatal sepsis in this study were; history of maternal urinary tract  infection or sexually transmitted infection [AOR = 5. 23; 95\% CI (1.82, 15.04)],  prolonged rupture of membrane [AOR = 7. 43; 95\% CI (2.04, 27.1)], Place of  delivery; health center delivery [AOR = 5. 7; 95\% CI (1.71, 19.03)], intrapartum  fever [AOR = 6. 1 95\% CI (1.29, 28.31)], APGAR score {$<$}7 at 5th minute [AOR = 68.  9; 95\% CI (3.63, 1308)] and not crying immediately at birth [AOR = 124. 0; 95\% CI  (6.5, 2379)]. CONCLUSION: Both maternal and neonatal factors had contributed to  the risk of neonatal sepsis. Strengthening of the existing risk based prevention  strategies as well as improvement of institutional delivery practices are  crucial.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Neonatal sepsis contributes substantially to neonatal mortality and morbidity and is an ongoing major global public health problem particularly in  developing countries. A significant proportion of mothers give birth in primary  health care, but studies regarding neonatal sepsis and its associated factors  among admitted neonates are limited to the hospital which may not be generalized  to the primary health care unit. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the  proportion of neonatal sepsis and associated factors in the study areas.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude of neonatal sepsis and its associated factors  among neonates admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) of Hawzen  Primary Hospital, Eastern Zone, Tigray, North Ethiopia, 2020. METHODS: An  institution-based cross-sectional study design was carried out among 290 study  participants in Hawzen Primary Hospital in January-March/2020. A systematic  random sampling method was applied to select the study participants, and  pretested and structured questionnaires were used to collect data. The collected  data were coded, entered, cleaned, and analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 software.  Binary logistic regression analyses with a confidence interval of 95\% were used  to select determinant factors. Statistically significant factors were identified  using the adjusted odds ratio (AOR). Statistical significance was determined at p  value {$<$}0.05. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied  to see the association of the variables at a p {$<$} 0.05. RESULTS: In this study,  the overall proportion of neonatal sepsis was (60.2\%) 95\% CI (56, 68)]. Birth  asphyxia [AOR\,=\,2.04; 95\%CI (1.07, 3.93)], maternal age of 15-19 [AOR\,=\,2.00; 95\%  CI (1.81, 11.93)], duration of labor greater or equal to 24\,hours [AOR\,=\,3.00;  95\% CI (2.67, 14.21)], history of oxygen administration [AOR\,=\,2.37; 95\% CI  (1.18, 4.75)], neonatal age of greater or equal to seven days [AOR\,=\,4.0595\% CI  (1.07, 3.93), and home delivery [AOR\,=\,5.00; 95\% CI (2.34, 18.92)] were the  predictor variables for neonatal sepsis. CONCLUSION: In this study, neonatal  sepsis was high. Birth asphyxia, intranasal oxygen administration, age of the  mother, home delivery, and duration of labor were associated with neonatal  sepsis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates across all regions, including Africa. Compared to developed and some  developing countries, there are relatively few epidemiological trends for  neonatal sepsis and associated patterns with COVID-19 in Ethiopia. We modeled an  epidemiological trend and pattern to aid in the monitoring of changes in neonatal  sepsis. METHODS: Retrospective data were collected from all admissions to the  Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in Ethiopia at Jimma Medical Center between  May 2019 and April 2022. We analyzed the monthly neonatal sepsis incidence,  mortality, and case-fatality rates using STATA software. Finally, we modeled a  monthly time series of neonatal sepsis incidence trends and patterns associated  with the COVID-19-impacted period using Joinpoint software. For all analyses, a P  value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant at the 95\% confidence  interval (CI). RESULTS: In the 36 months, 6796 cases were admitted to the NICU,  with a 9.5\% (95\% CI: 9.1, 10.0) incidence rate of neonatal sepsis. The overall  admission mortality rate was 16.5\% (95\% CI: 13.6, 19.8), while sepsis-attributed  mortality was 7.1\% (95\% CI: 5.8, 8.5). The data showed an unstable decreasing  trend for three Joinpoints (August 2020, December 2020, and August 2021).  Notably, a decrease in the incidence trend was observed from May 2019 to August  2020 (MPC, -4.1; 95\% CI: -7.6, -0.5; P = 0.03), followed by a sharp increase  (MPC, 23.7; 95\% CI: -13.8, 77.7; P = 0.24) from August 2020 to December 2020.  From December 2020 to August 2021, there was again a decreasing trend (MPC,  -13.8; 95\% CI: -23.3, -3.5; P = 0.01), followed by a slight increase from August  2021 to April 2022 (MPC, 4.2; 95\% CI: -8.4, 18.6; P = 0.52). Finally, the study  revealed an association between patterns of neonatal sepsis incidence trends and  COVID-19, with a Joinpoint jump model comparability ratio (CR = 0.43) between  pre- and COVID-19-impacted periods. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal sepsis was prevalent at  Jimma Medical Center, but it was on an unstably declining trend. The current  results suggest a potential temporal association between the intensity of  COVID-19 containment measures and a change in the incidence trend and patterns of  neonatal sepsis. However, the quantified contribution of a particular containment  measure requires further investigation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacteremia is prevalent in neonates, largely attributed to factors inherent in the neonatal period. However, the prevalence of proven bacteremia in  Ethiopian neonates has not been previously synthesized. Accordingly, this  systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to analyze the prevalence of bacteremia  and pathogen profiles in neonates hospitalized for clinical sepsis in Ethiopia.  METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the preferred  reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) 2020. The  literature search was conducted across five databases including PubMed, Google  Scholar, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Research for Life spanning from  January 2015 to July 2023. The search strategy used MeSH terms and involved  screening titles and abstracts, reviewing full-text articles, and including only  observational studies published in English within the specified timeframe. Data  extraction and quality assessment were performed by three experienced reviewers  using a validated data collection tool and the Joanna Briggs Institute quality  assessment tool, respectively. The prevalence of neonatal bacteremia was  determined through a random effects model, with heterogeneity among studies  assessed using the Q statistic and the I(2) statistic. Publication bias was  evaluated using a funnel plot and Egger's regression test, and STATA version 16.0  was used for all analysis at 95\% confidence level. RESULTS: A meta-analysis of  nine studies revealed a bacteremia prevalence of 40.0\% (95\% CI: 34.0-46.0\%).  Subgroup analysis indicated variations in prevalence based on regions and study  designs, with Oromia at 44.0\% (95\% CI: 28.0, 61.0\%) and Amhara at 39.0\% (95\% CI:  27.0, 51.0\%). Longitudinal studies exhibited a higher prevalence (47.0\%, 95\% CI:  27.0-68.0\%) compared to cross-sectional designs (38.0\%, 95\% CI: 32.0-44.0\%).  Gram-negative bacteria were identified as the predominant etiological agents,  representing 59.5\% (95\% CI: 56.8-62.3\%) of cases. Among the bacterial species,  Staphylococcus aureus emerged as the most prevalent (20.0\%, 95\% CI: 18.0\%,  22.0\%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and Klebsiella pneumoniae,  each contributing to 17.0\% (95\% CI: 15.0\%, 20.0\%) of bacteremia cases.  CONCLUSION: The study revealed a significant high prevalence of bacteremia, with  differences noted across regions and study designs. Key pathogens identified were  Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and coagulase-negative  staphylococci. It is advisable to implement surveillance systems, targeted  prevention strategies, diagnostic stewardship, and further research on regional  variations and bacterial profiles to effectively enhance the ominous future.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Klebsiella bacterial strains harboring Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) enzymes are the primary culprits behind neonatal sepsis  globally. These strains significantly impact clinical outcomes due to their  multi-drug resistance patterns in local healthcare settings. In response to this  spiraling threat, we studied the prevalence and clinical implications of  ESBL-encoding genes in neonates hospitalized with confirmed sepsis. METHODS: A  correlational study was conducted on 51 neonates diagnosed with sepsis caused by  ESBL-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae at Jimma Medical Center spanning from May  2022 to July 2023. Antimicrobial resistance profiles of the bacterial isolates  were determined using the Kirby-Bauer diffusion test, while multiplex polymerase  chain reaction (mPCR) techniques were employed to identify resistance genes. The  correlation between resistance genes and treatment outcomes was analyzed using  the phi coefficient ({$\varphi$}) with a significance level below 0.05. The data management  was executed through the utilization of WHONET and STATA software platforms.  RESULTS: The sample consisted of 26 (50.9\%) male and the remaining 25 (49.1\%)  female neonates, with diverse clinical characteristics. All 51 Klebsiella  pneumoniae isolates were 100\% resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and  ceftriaxone, but showed varying resistance profiles ranging from 30.8\% to  meropenem to 94.2\% to ceftazidime. Notably, all isolates demonstrated multidrug  resistance, with 23\% of cases showing resistance to seven different antimicrobial  classes. The most prevalent resistance genes identified were bla(CTX-M) (96.1\%),  bla(TEM) (94.1\%), and bla(SHV) (88.2\%). The majority of isolates (94.1\%) carried  at least two resistance genes, such as bla(TEM) and bla(CTX) (94.1\%), bla(TEM)  and bla(SHV) (86.2\%), and bla(CTX) and bla(SHV) (86.2\%). Notably, 84.3\% of the  bacteria harbored the trio of bla(TEM), bla(CTX), and bla(SHV) resistance genes,  and only the presence of bla(SHV) in monogenic ({$\varphi$}\,=\,0.4, P\,=\,0.01) or the trio of  bla(TEM), bla(CTX), and bla(SHV) genes ({$\varphi$}\,=\,0.3, P\,=\,0.02) showed positive  correlation with neonatal mortality. CONCLUSION: We observed a significant  prevalence of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains among neonates.  Moreover, ESBL-resistance genes were widespread, with the blaSHV gene showing a  correlation with increased neonatal mortality. These findings emphasize the  urgent need for enhanced infection prevention measures, robust antimicrobial  resistance surveillance, innovative treatment strategies, antibiotic stewardship  initiatives, further research into resistance transfer mechanisms as well as  hierarchical predictors of neonatal mortality.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological profiles and the rundown crisis of antimicrobial resistance from bacterial isolates in neonatal sepsis compel regular surveillance  to enhance data-driven decision-making. Accordingly, this study aimed to assess  the phenotypic epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacteria  isolated from clinically suspected neonatal sepsis in Ethiopia. METHODS: A total  of 342 neonates suspected of clinical sepsis were randomly included in a  prospective observational study conducted at the neonatal intensive care unit  (NICU) of Jimma medical center (JMC) from May 2022 to July 2023. Blood samples  were collected from each neonate and subjected to a culture test for  identification of bacterial isolates and their antibiotic resistance profiles  following the standardized guidelines. The laboratory results, along with  relevant clinical data, were recorded using WHONET and analyzed using STATA  software. RESULTS: Out of the 342 blood samples that were analyzed, 138 samples  (40.4\%, 95\% CI: 35.1-45.6, P{$<$}0.01) exhibited proven bacterial infection. The  infection rates were notably higher in males with 85/138 (61.6\%, 95\% CI:  53.4-69.8, P{$<$}0.01) and neonates aged 0-3 days with 81/138 (58.7\%, 95\% CI:  50.5-66.9, P{$<$}0.01). The majority of the infections were attributed to  Gram-negative bacteria, accounting for 101/138(73.2\%, 95\% CI: 65.6-80.7) cases,  with 69/101(68.3\%, 95\% CI: 63.8-72.8) cases involving ESBL-producing strains,  while Gram-positive bacteria were responsible for 26.8\% (95\% CI: 19.3-34.4) of  the infections. The predominant isolates included Klebsiella pneumoniae (37.7\%,  95\% CI: 29.6-45.8), Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNs) (20.3\%, 95\% CI:  13.6-27.0), and Acinetobacter species (11.6\%, 95\% CI: 6.0-17.1). Of the total  cases, 43/72 (59.7\%, 95\% CI: 48.4-71.1, P{$<$}0.01) resulted in mortality, with 28/72  (38.9\%, 95\% CI: 27.70-50.1, P{$<$}0.03) deaths linked to Extended-Spectrum  Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains. Klebsiella pneumoniae displayed high  resistance rates to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (100\%), ceftriaxone (100\%),  cefotaxime (98.1\%), ceftazidime (90.4\%), and gentamicin (84.6\%). Acinetobacter  species showed resistance to ampicillin (100\%), cefotaxime (100\%),  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (75\%), ceftazidime (68.8\%), chloramphenicol  (68.8\%), and ceftriaxone (68.8\%). Likewise, CoNs displayed resistance to  ampicillin (100\%), penicillin (100\%), cefotaxime (86.0\%), gentamicin (57.2\%), and  oxacillin (32.2\%). Multidrug resistance was observed in 88.4\% (95\% CI: 81.8-93.0)  of isolates, with ESBL-producers significantly contributing (49.3\%, 95\% CI:  45.1-53.5). Furthermore, 23.0\% (95\% CI: 15.8-31.6) exhibited a prevalent  resistance pattern to seven distinct antibiotic classes. CONCLUSION: The  prevalence and mortality rates of neonatal sepsis were significantly high at JMC,  with a notable surge in antibiotic and multidrug resistance among bacterial  strains isolated from infected neonates, specifically ESBL-producers. These  resistant strains have a significant impact on infection rates and resistance  profiles, highlighting the requisite for enhanced diagnostic and antimicrobial  stewardship, stringent infection control, and further molecular characterization  of isolates to enhance neonatal survival.},

However, power analysis is flawed in that a narrow emphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study design. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can often be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M [magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.},

MEASUREMENTS: Polypharmacy, defined as use of five or more medications and a cohort-specific alternate definition of eight or more medications, was examined. Velocity (cm/s) measured quantitatively during NW and WWT conditions. RESULTS: The 164 participants (34\%) with polypharmacy of five or more medications were older (77.0 +/- 6.6 vs 76.0 +/- 6.4) and more likely to have hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, and higher body mass index (BMI) and to have fallen within the last year than the remaining 318 without polypharmacy and walked 6 cm/s slower (P = .004) during NW and 4 cm/s slower during WWT (P = .07), adjusting for age, sex, and education. Group differences were not statistically significant after adjusting for comorbidities. Prevalence of polypharmacy of eight or more medications was 10\%. This group walked 11 cm/s slower during NW (P {$<$} .001) and 8.6 cm/s slower during WWT (P = .01) than those without polypharmacy, adjusted for age, sex, and education. Participants taking eight or more medications had slower NW (8.5 cm/s; P = .01), and WWT (6.9 cm/s; P = .07), compared to those without polypharmacy, adjusting for comorbidities. Adjustments for BMI, high-risk drugs, falls, and comorbidities yielded slower NW (9.4 cm/s, P = .005) and WWT (7.9 cm/s, P = .04 among those with polypharmacy compared to those without polypharmacy). CONCLUSION: These results suggest an association between polypharmacy and locomotion that medical comorbidities only partly explained.},

The major theories of aging are considered. We discuss what makes a model useful in general and for aging research in particular. We suggest criteria for the selection of paradigms for the study of aging. The criteria we suggest for identifying underlying mechanisms that lead to age related changes are: intraspecies universality, intrinsicality, progressiveness, and interspecies universality. The subsequent articles of this series shall consider the merits and possible drawbacks of some of the most commonly used models of the biology of aging: (a) the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae; (b) the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster; (c) mammalian cells in culture and telomerase model; (d) mitochondria and aging; (e) progeroid syndromes; (f) in vivo studies with laboratory rodent strains; and (g) plant senescence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Epidemiologic studies have shown a relationship between glycated hemoglobin levels and cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes. We investigated whether intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin levels would reduce cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who had either established cardiovascular disease or additional cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS In this randomized study, 10,251 patients (mean age, 62.2 years) with a median glycated hemoglobin level of 8.1\% were assigned to receive intensive therapy (targeting a glycated hemoglobin level below 6.0\%) or standard therapy (targeting a level from 7.0 to 7.9\%). Of these patients, 38\% were women, and 35\% had had a previous cardiovascular event. The primary outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. The finding of higher mortality in the intensive-therapy group led to a discontinuation of intensive therapy after a mean of 3.5 years of follow-up.  RESULTS At 1 year, stable median glycated hemoglobin levels of 6.4\% and 7.5\% were achieved in the intensive-therapy group and the standard-therapy group, respectively. During follow-up, the primary outcome occurred in 352 patients in the intensive-therapy group, as compared with 371 in the standard-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.04; P=0.16). At the same time, 257 patients in the intensive-therapy group died, as compared with 203 patients in the standard-therapy group (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95\% CI, 1.01 to 1.46; P=0.04). Hypoglycemia requiring assistance and weight gain of more than 10 kg were more frequent in the intensive-therapy group (P{$<$}0.001).  CONCLUSIONS As compared with standard therapy, the use of intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin levels for 3.5 years increased mortality and did not significantly reduce major cardiovascular events. These findings identify a previously unrecognized harm of intensive glucose lowering in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00000620. opens in new tab.)},

  abstract = {Aaron Antonovsky's sense of coherence (SOC) [(1987) Unraveling the Mystery of Health, How People Manage Stress and Stay Well, Jossey-Bass, San Francisco] ought to explain why some people manage stress and stay well while others break down. According to Antonovsky's formulation, SOC is strongly developed if a person sees the world as comprehensible (i.e. rational, understandable, consistent and predictable), as manageable, and as meaningful (i.e. challenging and that things are worth making commitments for). Sense of coherence has gained widespread attention and has been used as an explanatory variable in many studies. This paper discusses some aspects that have not sufficiently been considered in the SOC literature. First, an outline of the construct is given. Next, overlaps and differences with other concepts in the same domain are discussed. Little empirical evidence concerning the stability of SOC is available. Therefore, findings from experimental social psychological studies on self-esteem are applied to SOC. Third, it can be assumed that SOC is an attitude of people who are well educated, are in rather privileged societal positions, and with opportunities for decision-making. Finally, the empirical basis is reviewed. Statistical relationships between SOC and symptoms/disease are in the predicted direction, but due to the simultaneous assessment of variables it is open to debate whether a low SOC has some effect on the probability of falling ill or whether it is the other way around. Very high negative correlations between SOC and depression/anxiety suggest that the instruments used may assess the same phenomenon, but with inverse signs. Based on these considerations, directions for further research are proposed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data on neonatal bloodstream infections (BSI) in sub-Saharan Africa are extremely limited. METHODS: A comparative analysis of  laboratory-confirmed neonatal BSI episodes was conducted retrospectively in two  large neonatal units in Botswana and South Africa (January 1 to December 31,  2017). Routine laboratory and ward register data were used to determine BSI  rates, the pathogen spectrum, and BSI outcomes. RESULTS: In 2017, the Princess  Marina Hospital (PMH) and Tygerberg Hospital (TBH) neonatal units admitted 1187  and 2826 neonates, respectively. The BSI incidence rate was 12.1/1000  patient-days (95\% confidence interval (CI) 10.2-14.3) at PMH and 3.5/1000  patient-days (95\% CI 2.9-4.1) at TBH (p {$<$} 0.0001). Most BSI episodes were  hospital-acquired (260/284; 91.6\%). The blood culture contamination rate was  substantially higher at PMH than TBH (152/1116 (13.6\%) vs 122/2559 (4.8\%); p {$<$}  0.001). The crude mortality rate in neonates with BSI was 21.2\% (53/250) and  significantly higher at TBH than PMH (38/128 (29.7\%) vs 15/122 (12.3\%), p =  0.001). Factors independently associated with death were birth weight {$<$}1500 g  (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.8, 95\% CI 1.3-6.4; p = 0.02) and male sex (aOR 2.1,  95\% CI 1.1-3.7; p = 0.01). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the dominant BSI pathogen in  both units, accounting for two-thirds of BSI, and was associated with a large  infection outbreak at PMH. Antibiotic resistance rates were substantial in both  neonatal units, particularly for K. pneumoniae (98/122 (80.3\%), extended-spectrum  beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producers) and Staphylococcus aureus (22/33 (66.7\%),  methicillin-resistant). CONCLUSIONS: BSI rates and associated mortality were  substantial in these two neonatal units in sub-Saharan Africa. ESBL-producing K.  pneumoniae remains a leading BSI and outbreak pathogen.},

Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is rapidly increasing and  carriages a major threat to neonates. We aimed to examine phenotypes causing  neonatal late onset sepsis (NLOS) in comparison with neonatal early onset sepsis  (NEOS) with further investigations of genotypes, and genetic relatedness of CRKP  in neonatal late-onset sepsis. Our study included 88 neonates diagnosed with  sepsis: 58 with (NLOS) and 30 with (NEOS) from November 2015 to April 2016, at  neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Cairo University Hospital. K. pneumoniae  was the most common encountered pathogen in the NLOS group (37.9\%) with a mean  sepsis score of 6.39 when compared to the NEOS group (p {$<$} 0.05). In Klebsiella  group, C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels were significantly high (p ˂  0.001) and 56.5\% of the isolates were meropenem resistant. The most prevalent  carbapenemase gene was OXA-48 which was identified in 14/23 (60.8\%) followed by  NDM-1 which was identified in 12/23 (52.2\%) as detected by multiplex PCR.  Coexistence of both carbapenemases was found in 52.2\% (12/23). The bla(KPC),  bla(IMP), and bla(VIM) genes were not harbored in the isolates. By investigating  the genetic relatedness of CRKP by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, 23 isolates  of K. pneumoniae revealed various pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)  patterns, demonstrating that the isolates were non-clonal. Awareness of the  existing phenotypes and genotypes is important for proper treatment and infection  control practices.},

METHODS: A literature search of electronic databases was conducted for published articles from database inception to February 2017. Eligible articles included the assessment of HL in CAD patients. Health behaviors and outcomes included diet, exercise, smoking, medication use, hospital readmission, knowledge, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and psychosocial indicators. RESULTS: Overall, ten articles were included, of which two were RCTs, and seven were considered "good" quality. The most used screening instruments were REALM and TOFHLA. The average prevalence of low HL was 30.5\%. Low HL participants were more likely to be older, male, from a non-white ethnic group, have many CVD comorbidities, lower educational level, disadvantaged socioeconomic position, and less likely to be employed. Low HL was consistently associated with hospital readmissions, low HRQoL, higher anxiety and lower social support. CONCLUSION: The literature on HL in CAD patients is very limited. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Healthcare providers should start adopting strategies that can potentially mitigate the impact of low HL in the care of CAD patients.},

  abstract = {Background               Positive psychosocial factors can play an important role in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among them, psychological resilience (PR) is defined as the capacity of responding positively to stressful events. Our aim was to assess whether PR is associated with CVD or metabolic disturbances through a systematic review.                                         Methods               We gathered articles from PubMed, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar up to October 28, 2021. We included articles that were in English, were observational, and had PR examined as exposure. The CVD outcomes were either clinical or metabolic outcomes (i.e., dyslipidemia, obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and diabetes).                                         Results               Our literature search identified 3,800 studies, of which 17 met the inclusion criteria. Of them, seven were longitudinal and 10 cross-sectional, and 13 were on adults and four on children. The exposure assessment was heterogeneous, i.e., 12 studies used different kinds of self-administered questionnaires and five used interviews with a psychologist. Regarding outcomes, five studies investigated CVD, seven obesity, one metabolic syndrome, two hypertension, four dyslipidemia, and four diabetes. In longitudinal studies, PR was found to have an inverse association with included outcomes in five studies from the Swedish military conscription cohort but had no association with CVD in a study on African-American women and was associated with slower progression of diabetes in a general population. The cross-sectional studies showed that the prevalence of disease was not associated with PR in many cases but the progression of disease was associated with PR.                                         Conclusion               PR seems to have a possibly favorable association with CVD and metabolic disturbances that differs according to the type of outcome and population. Our study limitations are given by the small number of studies available and the heterogeneity in PR measurement.

Failure to protect patients from avoidable harm, including HAIs, has significant ethical implications; it often reflects both organisational systems failure and non-compliance of health care workers with evidence-based policies, including hand hygiene.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known about the natural course of frailty. We performed a prospective study to determine the transition rates between frailty states and to evaluate the effect of the preceding frailty state on subsequent frailty transitions. METHODS: We studied 754 community-living persons, aged 70 years or older, who were nondisabled in 4 essential activities of daily living. Frailty, assessed every 18 months for 54 months, was defined on the basis of weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity, muscle weakness, and slow walking speed. Participants were classified as frail if they met 3 or more of these criteria, as prefrail if they met 1 or 2 of the criteria, and as nonfrail if they met none of the criteria. RESULTS: Of the 754 participants, 434 (57.6\%) had at least 1 transition between any 2 of the 3 frailty states during 54 months. The rates were 36.8\%, 21.5\%, and 9.2\% for 1, 2, and 3 transitions, respectively. During the 18-month intervals, transitions to states of greater frailty were more common (rates up to 43.3\%) than transitions to states of lesser frailty (rates up to 23.0\%), and the probability of transitioning from being frail to nonfrail was very low (rates, 0\%-0.9\%), even during an extended period. The likelihood of transitioning between frailty states was highly dependent on one's preceding frailty state. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty among older persons is a dynamic process, characterized by frequent transitions between frailty states over time. Our findings suggest ample opportunity for the prevention and remediation of frailty.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 30\% of people over 65 years of age living in the community fall each year. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions designed to reduce the incidence of falls in older people living in the community. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (February 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1946 to March 2012), EMBASE (1947 to March 2012), CINAHL (1982 to February 2012), and online trial registers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of interventions to reduce falls in community-dwelling older people. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used a rate ratio (RaR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) to compare the rate of falls (e.g. falls per person year) between intervention and control groups. For risk of falling, we used a risk ratio (RR) and 95\% CI based on the number of people falling (fallers) in each group. We pooled data where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: We included 159 trials with 79,193 participants. Most trials compared a fall prevention intervention with no intervention or an intervention not expected to reduce falls. The most common interventions tested were exercise as a single intervention (59 trials) and multifactorial programmes (40 trials). Sixty-two per cent (99/159) of trials were at low risk of bias for sequence generation, 60\% for attrition bias for falls (66/110), 73\% for attrition bias for fallers (96/131), and only 38\% (60/159) for allocation concealment.Multiple-component group exercise significantly reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.71, 95\% CI 0.63 to 0.82; 16 trials; 3622 participants) and risk of falling (RR 0.85, 95\% CI 0.76 to 0.96; 22 trials; 5333 participants), as did multiple-component home-based exercise (RaR 0.68, 95\% CI 0.58 to 0.80; seven trials; 951 participants and RR 0.78, 95\% CI 0.64 to 0.94; six trials; 714 participants). For Tai Chi, the reduction in rate of falls bordered on statistical significance (RaR 0.72, 95\% CI 0.52 to 1.00; five trials; 1563 participants) but Tai Chi did significantly reduce risk of falling (RR 0.71, 95\% CI 0.57 to 0.87; six trials; 1625 participants).Multifactorial interventions, which include individual risk assessment, reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.67 to 0.86; 19 trials; 9503 participants), but not risk of falling (RR 0.93, 95\% CI 0.86 to 1.02; 34 trials; 13,617 participants).Overall, vitamin D did not reduce rate of falls (RaR 1.00, 95\% CI 0.90 to 1.11; seven trials; 9324 participants) or risk of falling (RR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.89 to 1.03; 13 trials; 26,747 participants), but may do so in people with lower vitamin D levels before treatment.Home safety assessment and modification interventions were effective in reducing rate of falls (RR 0.81, 95\% CI 0.68 to 0.97; six trials; 4208 participants) and risk of falling (RR 0.88, 95\% CI 0.80 to 0.96; seven trials; 4051 participants). These interventions were more effective in people at higher risk of falling, including those with severe visual impairment. Home safety interventions appear to be more effective when delivered by an occupational therapist.An intervention to treat vision problems (616 participants) resulted in a significant increase in the rate of falls (RaR 1.57, 95\% CI 1.19 to 2.06) and risk of falling (RR 1.54, 95\% CI 1.24 to 1.91). When regular wearers of multifocal glasses (597 participants) were given single lens glasses, all falls and outside falls were significantly reduced in the subgroup that regularly took part in outside activities. Conversely, there was a significant increase in outside falls in intervention group participants who took part in little outside activity.Pacemakers reduced rate of falls in people with carotid sinus hypersensitivity (RaR 0.73, 95\% CI 0.57 to 0.93; three trials; 349 participants) but not risk of falling. First eye cataract surgery in women reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.66, 95\% CI 0.45 to 0.95; one trial; 306 participants), but second eye cataract surgery did not.Gradual withdrawal of psychotropic medication reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.34, 95\% CI 0.16 to 0.73; one trial; 93 participants), but not risk of falling. A prescribing modification programme for primary care physicians significantly reduced risk of falling (RR 0.61, 95\% CI 0.41 to 0.91; one trial; 659 participants).An anti-slip shoe device reduced rate of falls in icy conditions (RaR 0.42, 95\% CI 0.22 to 0.78; one trial; 109 participants). One trial (305 participants) comparing multifaceted podiatry including foot and ankle exercises with standard podiatry in people with disabling foot pain significantly reduced the rate of falls (RaR 0.64, 95\% CI 0.45 to 0.91) but not the risk of falling.There is no evidence of effect for cognitive behavioural interventions on rate of falls (RaR 1.00, 95\% CI 0.37 to 2.72; one trial; 120 participants) or risk of falling (RR 1.11, 95\% CI 0.80 to 1.54; two trials; 350 participants).Trials testing interventions to increase knowledge/educate about fall prevention alone did not significantly reduce the rate of falls (RaR 0.33, 95\% CI 0.09 to 1.20; one trial; 45 participants) or risk of falling (RR 0.88, 95\% CI 0.75 to 1.03; four trials; 2555 participants).No conclusions can be drawn from the 47 trials reporting fall-related fractures.Thirteen trials provided a comprehensive economic evaluation. Three of these indicated cost savings for their interventions during the trial period: home-based exercise in over 80-year-olds, home safety assessment and modification in those with a previous fall, and one multifactorial programme targeting eight specific risk factors. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Group and home-based exercise programmes, and home safety interventions reduce rate of falls and risk of falling.Multifactorial assessment and intervention programmes reduce rate of falls but not risk of falling; Tai Chi reduces risk of falling.Overall, vitamin D supplementation does not appear to reduce falls but may be effective in people who have lower vitamin D levels before treatment.},

  abstract = {AimThis study aimed to explore attitudes, beliefs and experiences regarding polypharmacy and discontinuing medications, or deprescribing, among community living older adults aged {$\geq$}65 years, using {$\geq$}5 medications. It also aimed to investigate if health literacy capabilities influenced attitudes and beliefs towards deprescribing.BackgroundPolypharmacy use is common among Australian older adults. However, little is known about their attitudes towards polypharmacy use or towards stopping medications. Previous studies indicate that health literacy levels tend to be lower in older adults, resulting in poor knowledge about medications.MethodsA self-administered survey was conducted using two previously validated tools; the Patients' Attitude Towards Deprescribing (PATD) tool to measure attitudes towards polypharmacy use and deprescribing and the All Aspects of Health Literacy Scale (AAHLS) to measure functional, communicative and critical health literacy. Descriptive statistical analysis was conducted.FindingsThe 137 responses showed that 80\% thought all their medications were necessary and were comfortable with the number taken. Wanting to reduce the number of medications taken was associated with concerns about the amount taken (P{$<$}0.001), experiencing side effects (P{$<$}0.001), or believing that one or more medications were no longer needed (P{$<$}0.000). Those who were using ten or more medications were more likely to want to reduce the number taken (P=0.019). Most (88\%) respondents would be willing to stop medication/s in the context of receiving this advice from their doctor. Willingness to consider stopping correlated with higher scores on the critical health literacy subscale (P{$<$}0.021) and overall AAHLS score (P{$<$}0.009). Those with higher scores on the overall AAHLS measure were more likely to report that they understood why their medications were prescribed (P{$<$}0.000) and were more likely to participate in decision-making (P=0.027). Opportunities to proactively consider deprescribing may be missed, as one third of the respondents could not recall a recent review of their medications.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess whether differences in readmission rates between safety-net hospitals (SNH) and non-SNHs are due to differences in hospital quality, and to compare the results of hospital profiling with and without SES adjustment. BACKGROUND: In response to concerns that quality measures unfairly penalizes SNH, NQF recently recommended that performance measures adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) when SES is a risk factor for poor patient outcomes. METHODS: Multivariate regression was used to examine the association between SNH status and 30-day readmission after major surgery. The results of hospital profiling with and without SES adjustment were compared using the CMS Hospital Compare and the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) methodologies. RESULTS: Adjusting for patient risk and SES, patients admitted to SNHs were not more likely to be readmitted compared with patients in in non-SNHs (AOR 1.08; 95\% CI:0.95-1.23; P = 0.23). The results of hospital profiling based on Hospital Compare were nearly identical with and without SES adjustment (ICC 0.99, kappa 0.96). Using the HRRP threshold approach, 61\% of SNHs were assigned to the penalty group versus 50\% of non-SNHs. After adjusting for SES, 51\% of SNHs were assigned to the penalty group. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in surgery readmissions between SNHs and non-SNHs are due to differences in the patient case mix of low-SES patients, and not due to differences in quality. Adjusting readmission measures for SES leads to changes in hospital ranking using the HRRP threshold approach, but not using the CMS Hospital Compare methodology. CMS should consider either adjusting for the effects of SES when calculating readmission thresholds for HRRP, or replace it with the approach used in Hospital Compare.},

  abstract = {Importance: Some parents are concerned that multiple vaccines in early childhood could weaken their child's immune system. Biological data suggest that increased vaccine antigen exposure could increase the risk for infections not targeted by vaccines. Objective: To examine estimated cumulative vaccine antigen exposure through the first 23 months of life in children with and without non-vaccine-targeted infections from 24 through 47 months of age. Design, Setting, and Participants: A nested case-control study was conducted in 6 US health care organizations participating in the Vaccine Safety Datalink. Cases were identified by International Classification of Diseases codes for infectious diseases in the emergency department and inpatient medical settings and then validated by medical record review. Cases of non-vaccine-targeted infection were matched to controls by age, sex, health care organization site, and chronic disease status. Participants were children ages 24 through 47 months, born between January 1, 2003, and September 31, 2013, followed up until December 31, 2015. Exposures: Cumulative vaccine antigen exposure, estimated by summing the number of antigens in each vaccine dose received from birth through age 23 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: Non-vaccine-targeted infections, including upper and lower respiratory infections and gastrointestinal infections, from 24 through 47 months of age, and the association between these infections and estimated cumulative vaccine exposure from birth through 23 months. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate matched odds ratios representing the odds of non-vaccine-targeted infections for every 30-unit increase in estimated cumulative number of antigens received. Results: Among the 944 patients (193 cases and 751 controls), the mean (SD) age was 32.5 (6.3) months, 422 (45\%) were female, and 61 (7\%) had a complex chronic condition. Through the first 23 months, the estimated mean (SD) cumulative vaccine antigen exposure was 240.6 (48.3) for cases and 242.9 (51.1) for controls. The between-group difference for estimated cumulative antigen exposure was -2.3 (95\% CI, -10.1 to 5.4; P = .55). Among children with vs without non-vaccine-targeted infections from 24 through 47 months of age, the matched odds ratio for estimated cumulative antigen exposure through age 23 months was not significant (matched odds ratio, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.84 to 1.07). Conclusions and Relevance: Among children from 24 through 47 months of age with emergency department and inpatient visits for infectious diseases not targeted by vaccines, compared with children without such visits, there was no significant difference in estimated cumulative vaccine antigen exposure through the first 23 months of life.},

Younger children have varying roles and involvement; over time, as children reach adolescence, they have an increasing understanding of and participation in their healthcare. This chapter will review the epidemiology of health literacy in parents, adolescents, and children, and how this compares to the general adult population. It will highlight unique considerations regarding health literacy and pediatric health.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine an optimal discriminating number of concomitant medications associated with geriatric syndromes, functional outcomes, and mortality in community-dwelling older men. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Older men aged {$\geq$} 70 years (n=1,705), enrolled in the Concord Health and Aging in Men Project were studied. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis using the Youden Index and the area under the curve was performed to determine discriminating number of medications in relation to each outcome. RESULTS: The highest value of the Youden Index for frailty was obtained for a cutoff point of 6.5 medications compared with a cutoff of 5.5 for disability and 3.5 for cognitive impairment. For mortality and incident falls, the highest value of Youden Index was obtained for a cutoff of 4.5 medications. For every one increase in number of medications, the adjusted odds ratios were 1.13 (95\% confidence interval [CI]=1.06-1.21) for frailty, 1.08 (95\% CI=1.00-1.15) for disability, 1.09 (95\% CI=1.04-1.15) for mortality, and 1.07 (95\% CI=1.03-1.12) for incident falls. There was no association between increasing number of medications and cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: The study supports the use of five or more medications in the current definition of polypharmacy to estimate the medication-related adverse effects for frailty, disability, mortality, and falls.},

Although federal and state regulations are in place to address the care transitions between the hospital and nursing home, no such guidelines exist for the much larger population of community-dwelling frail older adults. Few studies have looked at interventions to prevent rehospitalizations in this large segment of the older adult population. Similarly, standardized disease management approaches that lower hospitalization rates in an independent adult population may not suffice for guiding the care of frail persons. Care management interventions currently face unique challenges in their attempt to improve the transitional care of community-dwelling older adults. However, impending national imperatives aimed at reducing potentially avoidable hospitalizations will soon demand and reward care management strategies that identify frail persons early in the discharge process and promote the sharing of critical information among patients, caregivers, and health care professionals. Opportunities to improve the quality and efficiency of care-related communications must focus on the effective blending of training and technology for improving communications vital to successful care transitions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Manual white blood cell (WBC) differential counts as a predictor for neonatal sepsis development in a low-resource setting have not been thoroughly  evaluated. We hypothesized that manual differentiation (specifically  immature:total [I:T] neutrophil ratios) would be feasible and useful as an  adjunct to predict early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS). Secondarily, we  hypothesized that vaccination with bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'e}rin (BCG) and oral polio  vaccine (OPV) could alter WBC differential counts and thus might reduce its  predictive performance. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study within a  randomized trial, randomizing healthy, high-risk newborns admitted to the nursery  at the national hospital in Guinea-Bissau 1:1 to BCG+OPV at admission or at  discharge (usual practice). Thin capillary blood films were prepared at 2~d of  age in a subset of 268 neonates. WBC counts were assessed by microscopy and  neonates were followed up for sepsis development within 2~weeks. RESULTS:  Ninety-eight percent (264/268) of smears provided interpretable reads. Of the 264  children, 136 had been randomized to receive BCG+OPV prior to sampling; the  remaining 128 were vaccinated at discharge. The I:T ratio (average 0.017) was  lower among children who did not develop clinical sepsis but did not predict  sepsis (p=0.70). Only three children had an I:T ratio {$>$}0.2 (associated with a  higher probability of clinical sepsis in previous studies) but did not develop  sepsis. Immunization did not alter WBC composition. CONCLUSIONS: Manual WBC  differentials are feasible in low-resource settings. WBC differentials are not  affected by standard newborn immunization. However, the I:T ratio had no value in  predicting subsequent development of sepsis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little information is available on the potential association between polypharmacy and risk of mortality. OBJECTIVE: To determine in a population-based study whether polypharmacy is associated with increased risk of mortality in elderly persons. METHODS: In this population-based, prospective study of 5,052 people aged 65 years and older (Neurological Disorders in Central Spain), current medications were recorded. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for sociodemographics and comorbidity factors, were used to assess the risk of death up to 13.3 years later, comparing the polypharmacy group ({$>$}/=6 drugs) to those who were taking 1-5 drugs and those in a nonmedicated group (0 drugs). RESULTS: Out of 5,052 participants, 2,550 (50.5\%) died over a median follow-up of 6.5 years, including 361 (28.8\%) deaths among 931 nonmedicated participants, 1,946 (51.4\%) deaths among 3,787 participants taking 1-5 drugs daily, and 243 (72.8\%) among 334 participants on polypharmacy. In an unadjusted Cox model, risk of mortality was increased in participants on polypharmacy [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.78, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2.36-3.27, p {$<$} 0.001) and in those taking between 1 and 5 drugs (HR = 1.47, 95\% CI: 1.31-1.64, p {$<$} 0.001) versus those who were nonmedicated (reference group). In a Cox model that adjusted for a variety of demographic factors and comorbidities, HR remained increased in participants on polypharmacy (HR = 1.83, 95\% CI: 1.51-2.21, p {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that polypharmacy is associated with increased risk of mortality in elderly people. The extent to which polypharmacy is the proximate cause rather than a marker of this increase risk remains to be determined.},

  abstract = {Recent national surveys in The United Republic of Tanzania have revealed poor standards of hygiene at birth in facilities. As more women opt for institutional  delivery, improving basic hygiene becomes an essential part of preventative  strategies for reducing puerperal and newborn sepsis. Our collaborative research  in Zanzibar provides an in-depth picture of the state of hygiene on maternity  wards to inform action. Hygiene was assessed in 2014 across all 37 facilities  with a maternity unit in Zanzibar. We used a mixed methods approach, including  structured and semi-structured interviews, and environmental microbiology. Data  were analysed according to the WHO 'cleans' framework, focusing on the  fundamental practices for prevention of newborn and maternal sepsis. For each  'clean' we explored the following enabling factors: knowledge, infrastructure  (including equipment), staffing levels and policies. Composite indices were  constructed for the enabling factors of the 'cleans' from the quantitative data:  clean hands, cord cutting, and birth surface. Results from the qualitative tools  were used to complement this information.Only 49\% of facilities had the  'infrastructural' requirements to enable 'clean hands', with the availability of  constant running water particularly lacking. Less than half (46\%) of facilities  met the 'knowledge' requirements for ensuring a 'clean delivery surface'; six out  of seven facilities had birthing surfaces that tested positive for multiple  potential pathogens. Almost two thirds of facilities met the 'infrastructure  (equipment) requirement' for 'clean cord'; however, disposable cord clamps being  frequently out of stock, often resulted in the use of non-sterile thread made of  fabric. This mixed methods approach, and the analytical framework based on the  WHO 'cleans' and the enabling factors, yielded practical information of direct  relevance to action at local and ministerial levels. The same approach could be  applied to collect and analyse data on infection prevention from maternity units  in other contexts.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Discharge planning is a routine feature of health systems in many countries. The aim of discharge planning is to reduce hospital length of stay and unplanned readmission to hospital, and to improve the co-ordination of services following discharge from hospital.This is the third update of the original review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of planning the discharge of individual patients moving from hospital. SEARCH METHODS: We updated the review using the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Social Science Citation Index (last searched in October 2015), and the US National Institutes of Health trial register (ClinicalTrials.gov). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared an individualised discharge plan with routine discharge care that was not tailored to individual participants. Participants were hospital inpatients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently undertook data analysis and quality assessment using a pre-designed data extraction sheet. We grouped studies according to patient groups (elderly medical patients, patients recovering from surgery, and those with a mix of conditions) and by outcome. We performed our statistical analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle, calculating risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data using fixed-effect meta-analysis. When combining outcome data was not possible because of differences in the reporting of outcomes, we summarised the reported data in the text. MAIN RESULTS: We included 30 trials (11,964 participants), including six identified in this update. Twenty-one trials recruited older participants with a medical condition, five recruited participants with a mix of medical and surgical conditions, one recruited participants from a psychiatric hospital, one from both a psychiatric hospital and from a general hospital, and two trials recruited participants admitted to hospital following a fall. Hospital length of stay and readmissions to hospital were reduced for participants admitted to hospital with a medical diagnosis and who were allocated to discharge planning (length of stay MD - 0.73, 95\% CI - 1.33 to - 0.12, 12 trials, moderate certainty evidence; readmission rates RR 0.87, 95\% CI 0.79 to 0.97, 15 trials, moderate certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether discharge planning reduces readmission rates for patients admitted to hospital following a fall (RR 1.36, 95\% CI 0.46 to 4.01, 2 trials, very low certainty evidence). For elderly patients with a medical condition, there was little or no difference between groups for mortality (RR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.79 to 1.24, moderate certainty). There was also little evidence regarding mortality for participants recovering from surgery or who had a mix of medical and surgical conditions. Discharge planning may lead to increased satisfaction for patients and healthcare professionals (low certainty evidence, six trials). It is uncertain whether there is any difference in the cost of care when discharge planning is implemented with patients who have a medical condition (very low certainty evidence, five trials). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: A discharge plan tailored to the individual patient probably brings about a small reduction in hospital length of stay and reduces the risk of readmission to hospital at three months follow-up for older people with a medical condition. Discharge planning may lead to increased satisfaction with healthcare for patients and professionals. There is little evidence that discharge planning reduces costs to the health service.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resistance to antibiotics is a major public-health problem and antibiotic use is being increasingly recognised as the main selective pressure driving this resistance. Our aim was to assess outpatient use of antibiotics and the association with resistance. METHODS: We investigated outpatient antibiotic use in 26 countries in Europe that provided internationally comparable distribution or reimbursement data, between Jan 1, 1997, and Dec 31, 2002, by calculating the number of defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day, according to WHO anatomic therapeutic chemical classification and DDD measurement methodology. We assessed the ecological association between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance rates using Spearman's correlation coefficients. FINDINGS: Prescription of antibiotics in primary care in Europe varied greatly; the highest rate was in France (32.2 DDD per 1000 inhabitants daily) and the lowest was in the Netherlands (10.0 DDD per 1000 inhabitants daily). We noted a shift from the old narrow-spectrum antibiotics to the new broad-spectrum antibiotics. We also recorded striking seasonal fluctuations with heightened winter peaks in countries with high yearly use of antibiotics. We showed higher rates of antibiotic resistance in high consuming countries, probably related to the higher consumption in southern and eastern Europe than in northern Europe. INTERPRETATION: These data might provide a useful method for assessing public-health strategies that aim to reduce antibiotic use and resistance levels.},

METHOD: Readmissions during the calendar year 2006 were examined using hospital in-patient enquiry data. Associations with clinical and demographic factors were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The medical emergency readmission rate to GUH, after correction for death during the index admission, was 19.5\%. Age 65 years or more, male gender, length of stay more than 7 days and primary diagnoses of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myocardial infarction, alcohol-related disease and heart failure during the index admission were significantly associated with readmission in univariate and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: The medical emergency readmission rate in GUH is comparable to other acute hospitals in Ireland and Britain. Further evaluation is needed to estimate the proportion of readmissions that are potentially avoidable.},

OBJECTIVE To determine whether predictors of readmission change within 30 days after discharge. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS Patients admitted between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010. MEASUREMENTS Factors related to the index hospitalization (acute illness burden, inpatient care process factors, and clinical indicators of instability at discharge) and unrelated factors (chronic illness burden and social determinants of health) and how they affect early readmissions (0 to 7 days after discharge) and late readmissions (8 to 30 days after discharge). RESULTS 13 334 admissions, representing 8078 patients, were included in the analysis. Early readmissions were associated with markers of acute illness burden, including length of hospital stay (odds ratio [OR], 1.02 [95\% CI, 1.00 to 1.03]) and whether a rapid response team was called for assessment (OR, 1.48 [CI, 1.15 to 1.89]); markers of chronic illness burden, including receiving a medication indicating organ failure (OR, 1.19 [CI, 1.02 to 1.40]); and social determinants of health, including barriers to learning (OR, 1.18 [CI, 1.01 to 1.38]). Early readmissions were less likely if a patient was discharged between 8:00 a.m. and 12:59 p.m. (OR, 0.76 [CI, 0.58 to 0.99]). Late readmissions were associated with markers of chronic illness burden, including receiving a medication indicating organ failure (OR, 1.24 [CI, 1.08 to 1.41]) or hemodialysis (OR, 1.61 [CI, 1.12 to 2.17]), and social determinants of health, including barriers to learning (OR, 1.24 [CI, 1.09 to 1.42]) and having unsupplemented Medicare or Medicaid (OR, 1.16 [CI, 1.01 to 1.33]). LIMITATION Readmissions were ascertained at 1 institution. CONCLUSION The time frame of 30 days after hospital discharge may not be homogeneous. Causal factors and readmission prevention strategies may differ for the early versus late periods.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between health literacy and health care costs, particularly for hospitalizations and emergency room services, has been previously observed. Health information interventions aimed at addressing the negative impacts of inadequate health literacy are needed. The MedEncentive Mutual Accountability and Information Therapy (MAIT) Program is a Web-based system designed to improve health and lower costs by aligning patient-doctor incentives. OBJECTIVE: In this mixed methods study of a Web-based patient-doctor aligned-incentive, information therapy program conducted in an 1800-member employee health plan, we aimed to (1) determine the program's quantitative impact on hospitalization and emergency room utilization and costs, and (2) assess survey responses about the program's perceived value. METHODS: We used a mixed methods, single within-group, pre-post, descriptive study design. We analyzed quantitative data using pre-post mean utilization and cost differences and summarized the data using descriptive statistics. We used open-ended electronic survey items to collect descriptive data and analyzed them using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Hospitalizations and emergency room visits per 1000 decreased 32\% (26.5/82.4) and 14\% (31.3/219.9), respectively, after we implemented the program in 2015-2017, relative to 2013-2014. Correspondingly, the plan's annual per capita expenditures declined US \$675 (95\% CI US \$470-865), or 10.8\% (\$675/\$6260), after program implementation in 2015-2017 (US \$5585 in 2013-2014 dollars), relative to the baseline years of 2013-2014 (US \$6260; P{$<$}.05). Qualitative findings suggested that respondents valued the program, benefiting from its educational and motivational aspects to better self-manage their health. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses suggested that the reported reductions in hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and costs were associated with the program. Qualitative findings indicated that targeted users perceived value in participating in the MAIT Program. Further research with controls is needed to confirm these outcomes and more completely understand the health improvement and cost-containment capabilities of this Web-based health information, patient-doctor, aligned-incentive program.},

  abstract = {Cognitive aging reflects not only loss but also adaptation to loss. The adult brain is capable of plastic change, including change in cortical representation. This has been seen in association not only with frank lesions but also in healthy individuals as a function of experience and training. This review considers the potential for adult plasticity together with evidence of a relation in old age between regional cortical atrophy/shrinkage and increased activation in neuroimaging. Those cortical regions shown most consistently to shrink in adulthood--prefrontal and parietal cortices--are the same regions showing increased regional activation in aging. Combining several strands of behavioral and neuroimaging evidence, the author argues that functional plasticity alters the course of cognitive aging. The author advances the hypothesis that losses in regional brain integrity drive functional reorganization through changes in processing strategy and makes specific predictions from that hypothesis.

  abstract = {Vaccination has made an enormous contribution to global health. Two major infections, smallpox and rinderpest, have been eradicated. Global coverage of vaccination against many important infectious diseases of childhood has been enhanced dramatically since the creation of WHO's Expanded Programme of Immunization in 1974 and of the Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunization in 2000. Polio has almost been eradicated and success in controlling measles makes this infection another potential target for eradication. Despite these successes, approximately 6.6 million children still die each year and about a half of these deaths are caused by infections, including pneumonia and diarrhoea, which could be prevented by vaccination. Enhanced deployment of recently developed pneumococcal conjugate and rotavirus vaccines should, therefore, result in a further decline in childhood mortality. Development of vaccines against more complex infections, such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV, has been challenging and achievements so far have been modest. Final success against these infections may require combination vaccinations, each component stimulating a different arm of the immune system. In the longer term, vaccines are likely to be used to prevent or modulate the course of some non-infectious diseases. Progress has already been made with therapeutic cancer vaccines and future potential targets include addiction, diabetes, hypertension and Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {Changes in concepts of health and disease have led to increased interest in health related quality of life in medicine. Quality of life measures tend to treat quality of life as a stable construct that can be measured externally. They do not consider people's differing expectations and assume that what quality of life means to people is stable over time. This paper reports on a study which aimed to find out how measures of oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) vary between and change within individuals. Longitudinal semi-structured open-ended interviews were carried out with twenty people with socially noticeable broken, decayed or missing teeth who were or were not seeking dental treatment. The data were collected and analysed using the iterative processes of grounded systems theory based on Glaserian (Theoretical Sensitivity, The Sociology Press, Mill Valley, CA, 1978) grounded theory and Luhmann's (Social Systems, Stanford University, Stanford, 1984) social systems theory. During the data analysis it emerged that participants' were adopting positions on seven dimensions of oral health relating to the positions that people would adopt with respect norm, attribution, trust, accessibility, commodity, authenticity, and character. The core distinction that accommodated people's varying positions was that people constructed their own margins of relevance of oral health. The margins of relevance indicated a variable from a hypothetical extreme of 'super-relevant' to the other extreme of 'not relevant'. The margins of relevance could shift, meaning that assessments of quality of life would vary. Oral health related quality of life is therefore defined as the cyclical and self-renewing interaction between the relevance and impact of oral health in everyday life.},

METHODS: This register-based open cohort study included all girls and women between 10 and 30 years of age in Sweden in 2006-2012 diagnosed with at least one of 49 prespecified autoimmune diseases (n = 70 265). Incidence rate ratios were estimated for new-onset autoimmune disease within 180 days of qHPV vaccination using Poisson regression adjusting for, country of birth, parental country of birth, parental income and parental education. RESULTS: A total of 70 265 girls and women had at least one of the 49 predefined autoimmune diseases; 16\% of these individuals received at least one dose of qHPV vaccine. In unvaccinated girls and women, 5428 new-onset autoimmune diseases were observed during 245 807 person-years at a rate of 22.1 (95\% CI 21.5-22.7) new events per 1000 person-years. In vaccinated girls and women, there were 124 new events during 7848 person-years at a rate of 15.8 (95\% CI 13.2-18.8) per 1000 person-years. There was no increase in the incidence of new-onset autoimmune disease associated with qHPV vaccination during the risk period; on the contrary, we found a slightly reduced risk (incidence rate ratio 0.77, 95\% CI 0.65-0.93). CONCLUSION: In this nationwide study, qHPV vaccination was not associated with increased incidence of new-onset autoimmune disease in girls and women with pre-existing autoimmune disease.},

  abstract = {AIMS: The objective of our study was to examine various existing chronic disease models, their elements and their role in the management of Diabetes, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and Cardiovascular diseases (CVD). METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed and CINHAL during a period of January 2003- March 2011. Following key terms were used either in single or in combination such as "Chronic Disease Model" AND "Diabetes Mellitus" OR "COPD" OR "CVD". RESULTS: A total of 23 studies were included in the final analysis. Majority of the studies were US-based. Five chronic disease models included Chronic Care Model (CCM), Improving Chronic Illness Care (ICIC), and Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions (ICCC), Stanford Model (SM) and Community based Transition Model (CBTM). CCM was the most studied model. Elements studied included delivery system design and self-management support (87\%), clinical information system and decision support (57\%) and health system organization (52\%). Elements including center care on the patient and family (13\%), patient safety (4\%), community policies (4\%), built integrated health care (4\%) and remote patient monitoring (4\%) have not been well studied. Other elements including support paradigm shift, manage political environment, align sectoral policies for health, use healthcare personnel more effectively, support patients in their communities, emphasize prevention, identify patient specific concerns related to the transition process, and health literacy between visits and treatments have also not been well studied in the existing literature. CONCLUSIONS: It was unclear to what extent the results generated is applicable to different populations and locations and therefore is an area of future research. Future studies are also needed to test chronic disease models in settings where more racially and ethnically representative patients receive chronic care. Future program development should also include information on other barriers including transportation issues, finances and lack of services. AD  -. ashish.joshi@unmc.edu.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unplanned hospital readmissions are common, expensive and often preventable. Strategies designed to reduce readmissions should target patients at high risk. The purpose of this study was to describe medical patients identified using a recently published and validated algorithm (the LACE index) as being at high risk for readmission and to examine their actual hospital readmission rates. METHODS: We used population-based administrative data to identify adult medical patients discharged alive from 6 hospitals in Toronto, Canada, during 2007. A LACE index score of 10 or higher was used to identify patients at high risk for readmission. We described patient and hospitalization characteristics among both the high-risk and low-risk groups as well as the 30-day readmission rates. RESULTS: Of 26~045 patients, 12.6\% were readmitted to hospital within 30 days and 20.9\% were readmitted within 90 days of discharge. High-risk patients (LACE {$\geq~$}10) accounted for 34.0\% of the sample but 51.7\% of the patients who were readmitted within 30 days. High-risk patients were readmitted with twice the frequency as other patients, had longer lengths of stay and were more likely to die during the readmission. INTERPRETATION: Using a LACE index score of 10, we identified patients with a high rate of readmission who may benefit from improved post-discharge care. Our findings suggest that the LACE index is a potentially useful tool for decision-makers interested in identifying appropriate patients for post-discharge interventions.},

RESULTS: In this study 504 randomly selected neonatal charts  were reviewed. The proportion of overall neonatal sepsis was 63.69\% (95\% CI  59.38, 67.79), where early-onset sepsis was 59.33\% (95\% CI 54.96, 63.55) and  late-onset sepsis was 4.17\% (95\% CI 2.73, 6.31). Maternal intra-partum fever,  season of birth and admission, vaginal mode of delivery and preterm gestational  age at birth increased the likelihood of overall and early-onset neonatal sepsis.  In conclusion of this study, neonatal sepsis remaining the leading cause of  morbidity among younger infants. Intra-partum conditions were major contributors  to neonatal sepsis. Thus, providing emphasis on associated factors in particular  and universal safe obstetric care in general is recommended.},

There is a close relationship between obesity-and lipid-related index and hypertension, which is recognized by recent studies. However, these studies have not systematically compared the relationship between the two. We aim to find the most effective obesity-and lipid-related index for predicting hypertension. Method A total of 9488 middle-aged and elderly people in China participated in this study. In this study, the subjects were divided into male and female groups by the definition of the 2018 Chinese Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension. Searching for the best predictors among 13 obesity-and lipid-related indicators through binary logistic regression analyses and receiver operator curve (ROC). These 13 indicators are body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-height ratio (WHtR), conicity index (CI), visceral adiposity index (VAI), Chinese visceral adiposity index (CVAI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), a body shape index (ABSI), body roundness index (BRI), triglyceride glucose index (TyG-index) and its correlation index (TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, TyG-WHtR) Results After adjusting bias, all 13 indexes are risk factors for hypertension. In ROC curve analysis, thirteen obesity-and lipid-related factors can predict the occurrence of hypertension. Among them, CVAI has the best prediction effect (male: AUC\,=\,0.660, female: AUC\,=\,0.699). AUC for WHtR was equal to that for BRI and TyG -WHtR in identifying hypertension in male. Similarly, AUC of TyG-BMI and BMI were the same. In females, AUC for WHtR and BRI were the same when predicting hypertension. AUC of ABSI was much lower than other test indexes. Conclusion In predicting hypertension, thirteen obesity-and lipid-related factors are effective. In addition, in males and females, CVAI is the best indicator to indicate hypertension. TyG-WHtR, WHtR, and BRI performed well in predicting metabolic syndrome in both males and females. ABSI has a poor ability to predict hypertension.},

Engage-In-Caring is a novel multicomponent intervention clearly dedicated to improve family caregiver engagement in the care of patients with complex care needs, by supporting them to develop a stronger consciousness of their role, needs and skills. METHOD: Engage-In-Caring intervention's efficacy and feasibility have been evaluated through a single arm pre-post observational pilot study settled in Rome. A qualitative phase, consisting of literature analysis of caregivers' unmet needs and a final revision from an experts' group, led to the structuration of the intervention, following the Caregiver Health Engagement Model (CHE-Model). Afterwards, a quantitative phase allowed understanding the feasibility of the intervention through Kruskal-Wallis test on a sample of 47 caregivers. RESULTS: Results showed a reduction of the physical burden (Chi Squared\,=\,6,483; p\,=\,.01) perceived by the caregivers and increase of the health literacy (Chi Squared\,=\,3,560; p\,=\,.059) after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Feasibility tests on caregivers of patients with complex care needs are promising: this pilot study suggests a first effectiveness evidence, particularly concerning aspects related to burden perception and improvements in health literacy. Randomised controlled trials on larger samples are needed.},

  abstract = {The analysis of repeated measures or panel data allows control of some of the biases which plague other observational studies, particularly unmeasured confounding. When this bias is suspected, and the research question is: 'Does a change in an exposure cause a change in the outcome?', a fixed effects approach can reduce the impact of confounding by time-invariant factors, such as the unmeasured characteristics of individuals. Epidemiologists familiar with using mixed models may initially presume that specifying a random effect (intercept) for every individual in the study is an appropriate method. However, this method uses information from both the within-individual/unit exposure-outcome association and the between-individual/unit exposure-outcome association. Variation between individuals may introduce confounding bias into mixed model estimates, if unmeasured time-invariant factors are associated with both the exposure and the outcome. Fixed effects estimators rely only on variation within individuals and hence are not affected by confounding from unmeasured time-invariant factors. The reduction in bias using a fixed effects model may come at the expense of precision, particularly if there is little change in exposures over time. Neither fixed effects nor mixed models control for unmeasured time-varying confounding or reverse causation.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Low health literacy (HL) and language negatively affect cancer screening and prevention behaviors; less is known about how they affect the patient's experience during cancer treatment. This study explores associations among HL, spoken language, and dimensions of cancer-related needs within 6 months of receiving a breast cancer diagnosis. METHODS: Women speaking English, Spanish, or Haitian Creole, enrolled in a patient navigation study at diagnosis, completed a survey in their primary spoken language at baseline and 6 months to characterize their cancer-related needs. HL was measured using the Brief Health Literacy Screening Tool. Outcomes included the Cancer Needs Distress Inventory (CaNDI; n = 38 items) and the Communication and Attitudinal Self-Efficacy scale (CASE-Cancer) for cancer (n = 12 items). Linear regressions measured the impact of HL and language on total CaNDI and CASE-Cancer scale for cancer scores and subscales, adjusted for demographics. RESULTS: At baseline, 262 women participated and 228 (87\%) followed up at 6 months. Of these, 38\% had adequate HL, 33\% had marginal HL, and 29\% had inadequate HL. Women with inadequate or marginal HL had higher median baseline CaNDI scores (P = .02) and lower self-efficacy scores (P = .008), relative to those with adequate HL. Haitian-Creole speakers had significantly lower CANDI scores at baseline (P = .03). Adjusting for demographics, differences in CaNDI scores at baseline remained significant for those with lower HL and Haitian-Creole speakers. At 6 months, differences in self-efficacy persisted for Haitian-Creole speakers. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that interventions oriented to mitigating HL and language barriers might reduce distress at the time of diagnosis and improve self-efficacy over the course of treatment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A short battery of physical performance tests was used to assess lower extremity function in more than 5,000 persons age 71 years and older in three communities. METHODS: Balance, gait, strength, and endurance were evaluated by examining ability to stand with the feet together in the side-by-side, semi-tandem, and tandem positions, time to walk 8 feet, and time to rise from a chair and return to the seated position 5 times. RESULTS: A wide distribution of performance was observed for each test. Each test and a summary performance scale, created by summing categorical rankings of performance on each test, were strongly associated with self-report of disability. Both self-report items and performance tests were independent predictors of short-term mortality and nursing home admission in multivariate analyses. However, evidence is presented that the performance tests provide information not available from self-report items. Of particular importance is the finding that in those at the high end of the functional spectrum, who reported almost no disability, the performance test scores distinguished a gradient of risk for mortality and nursing home admission. Additionally, within subgroups with identical self-report profiles, there were systematic differences in physical performance related to age and sex. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that performance measures can validly characterize older persons across a broad spectrum of lower extremity function. Performance and self-report measures may complement each other in providing useful information about functional status.},

Sweden now has unique possibilities for comparisons of drug use in large populations of institutionalized and home-dwelling elderly through linkage of the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register (SPDR) with the Swedish Social Services Register. OBJECTIVE: To compare PIDU in institutionalized versus home-dwelling elderly persons in Sweden. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective study of 1,260,843 home-dwelling and 86,721 institutionalized elderly individuals. We analyzed data on age, sex, and dispensed drugs for individuals aged 65 years or older registered in the SPDR from July to September 2008. Data on type of housing were retrieved from the Social Services Register. The main outcome measures of PIDU were use of anticholinergic drugs, long-acting benzodiazepines, concurrent use of 3 or more psychotropics, and potentially serious drug-drug interactions (DDIs). RESULTS: Thirty percent of the institutionalized and 12\% of the home-dwelling elderly were exposed to PIDU. Living in an institution was strongly associated with overall PIDU (OR 2.36; 95\% CI 2.29 to 2.44), use of anticholinergic drugs (OR 2.58; 95\% CI 2.48 to 2.68), long-acting benzodiazepines (OR 1.50; 95\% CI 1.41 to 1.60), and concurrent use of 3 or more psychotropics (OR 7.26; 95\% CI 6.96 to 7.59), after controlling for age, sex, and number of drugs (used as proxy for comorbidity). However, institutionalization was associated with a lower probability of potentially serious DDIs (OR 0.60; 95\% CI 0.55 to 0.65). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that institutionalization is a potential risk factor for PIDU. This implies that more cautious prescribing is warranted in institutions, where the frailest and most vulnerable elderly individuals reside. Research is needed to identify underlying risk factors for PIDU within these settings.},

Elder-care physicians reported weekly the number of cases of influenza-like illness, gastroenteritis, (probable) pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTIs) and all-cause mortality. Trends in the incidence of infection and mortality in relation to LTCF characteristics were calculated using multilevel univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Thirty LTCF participated for 3 years or more, 16 for 2 years and the remaining 12 LTCF for 1 year. During the study period, the median number of beds decreased from 158 to 139, whereas the percentage of residents with private bedrooms increased from 14\% to 87\%. UTIs were the most frequently reported infections, followed by (probable) pneumonia and gastroenteritis. Adjusted for calendar year and season, we observed a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of influenza-like illness (odds ratio (OR) = 0.8, P {$<$} 0.01) and (probable) pneumonia (OR = 0.8, P {$<$} 0.01) for each extra year an LTCF participated. Although there are other likely contributors, such as more private rooms and enhanced infection control measures, the decreasing trend of HAI in LTCFs participating in surveillance implies that surveillance is a valuable addition to current strategies to optimise infection control.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although an increased risk for death after hip fracture is well established, whether this excess mortality persists over time is unclear. PURPOSE: To determine the magnitude and duration of excess mortality after hip fracture in older men and women. DATA SOURCES: Electronic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE for English and non-English articles from 1957 to May 2009 and manual search of article references. STUDY SELECTION: Prospective cohort studies were selected by 2 independent reviewers. The studies had to assess mortality in women (22 cohorts) or men (17 cohorts) aged 50 years or older with hip fracture, carry out a life-table analysis, and display the survival curves of the hip fracture group and age- and sex-matched control groups. DATA EXTRACTION: Survival curve data and items relevant to study validity and generalizability were independently extracted by 2 reviewers. DATA SYNTHESIS: Time-to-event meta-analyses showed that the relative hazard for all-cause mortality in the first 3 months after hip fracture was 5.75 (95\% CI, 4.94 to 6.67) in women and 7.95 (CI, 6.13 to 10.30) in men. Relative hazards decreased substantially over time but did not return to rates seen in age- and sex-matched control groups. Through use of life-table methods, investigators estimated that white women having a hip fracture at age 80 years have excess annual mortality compared with white women of the same age without a fracture of 8\%, 11\%, 18\%, and 22\% at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years after injury, respectively. Men with a hip fracture at age 80 years have excess annual mortality of 18\%, 22\%, 26\%, and 20\% at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years after injury, respectively. LIMITATIONS: Cohort studies varied, sometimes markedly, in size, duration of observation, selection of control populations, ascertainment of death, and adjustment for comorbid conditions. Only published data that displayed findings with survival curves were examined. Publication bias was possible. CONCLUSION: Older adults have a 5- to 8-fold increased risk for all-cause mortality during the first 3 months after hip fracture. Excess annual mortality persists over time for both women and men, but at any given age, excess annual mortality after hip fracture is higher in men than in women.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: While dementia policy strategies emphasize the importance of partnerships between families and formal carers to provide tailored care and effectively allocate community resources, family carers often feel left out or excluded. Poor communication has been identified as one reason for the lack of good partnerships. Few studies have investigated how family carers seek to involve themselves when they experience sub-optimal services, and how their strategies may depend on different considerations and personal abilities. METHODS: Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 23 family carers to explore their experiences with, perspectives on, contributions to, and interactions with healthcare services provided to older adults living with dementia. To capture nuances and variations, a semi-structured interview guide was used. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A four-step analysis of the transcripts was conducted, informed by hermeneutic and phenomenological methodology. RESULTS: Two main involvement strategies were identified: 1) being "the hub in the wheel" and 2) getting the wheel rolling. The first strategy was used to support and complement health services, while the second was used to add momentum and leverage to arguments or processes. The two main strategies were used differently among participants, in part due to differences in personal resources and the ability to utilize these, but also in light of family carers' weighing conflicting concerns and perceived costs and benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness and acknowledgment of family carers' strategies, personal resources, and considerations may help policymakers and healthcare personnel when they build or maintain good partnerships together with family carers. A better understanding of family carers' own perspectives on carer involvement is a necessary precursor to developing good care partnerships.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy (ie, the use of multiple medications and/or the administration of more medications than are clinically indicated, representing unnecessary drug use) is common among the elderly. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this research was to provide a description of observational studies examining the epidemiology of polypharmacy and to review randomized controlled studies that have been published in the past 2 decades designed to reduce polypharmacy in older adults. METHODS: Materials for this review were gathered from a search of the MEDLINE database (1986-June 2007) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1986-June 2007) to identify articles in people aged {$>$}65 years. We used a combination of the following search terms: polypharmacy, multiple medications, polymedicine, elderly, geriatric, and aged. A manual search of the reference lists from identified articles and the authors' article files, book chapters, and recent reviews was conducted to identify additional articles. From these, the authors identified those studies that measured polypharmacy. RESULTS: The literature review found that polypharmacy continues to increase and is a known risk factor for important morbidity and mortality. There are few rigorously designed intervention studies that have been shown to reduce unnecessary polypharmacy in older adults. The literature review identified 5 articles, which are included here. All studies showed an improvement in polypharmacy. CONCLUSIONS: Many studies have found that various numbers of medications are associated with negative health outcomes, but more research is needed to further delineate the consequences associated with unnecessary drug use in elderly patients. Health care professionals should be aware of the risks and fully evaluate all medications at each patient visit to prevent polypharmacy from occurring.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Discharge from the hospital is a critical transition point in a patient's care. Incomplete handoffs at discharge can lead to adverse events for patients and result in avoidable rehospitalization. Care transitions are especially important for elderly patients and other high-risk patients who have multiple comorbidities. Standardizing the elements of the discharge process may help to address the gaps in quality and safety that occur when patients transition from the hospital to an outpatient setting. METHODS: The Society of Hospital Medicine's Hospital Quality and Patient Safety committee assembled a panel of care transition researchers, process improvement experts, and hospitalists to review the literature and develop a checklist of processes and elements required for ideal discharge of adult patients. The discharge checklist was presented at the Society of Hospital Medicine's Annual Meeting in April 2005, where it was reviewed and revised by more than 120 practicing hospitalists and hospital-based nurses, case managers, and pharmacists. The final checklist was endorsed by the Society of Hospital Medicine. RESULTS: The finalized checklist is a comprehensive list of the processes and elements considered necessary for optimal patient handoff at hospital discharge. This checklist focused on medication safety, patient education, and follow-up plans. CONCLUSIONS: The development of content and process standards for discharge is the first step in improving the handoff of care from the inpatient to the posthospital setting. Refining this checklist for patients with specific diagnoses, in specific age categories, and with specific discharge destinations may further improve information transfer and ultimately affect patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {The objectives of this study were to develop a computerized method to screen for potentially avoidable hospital readmissions using routinely collected data and a prediction model to adjust rates for case mix. We studied hospital information system data of a random sample of 3,474 inpatients discharged alive in 1997 from a university hospital and medical records of those (1,115) readmitted within 1 year. The gold standard was set on the basis of the hospital data and medical records: all readmissions were classified as foreseen readmissions, unforeseen readmissions for a new affection, or unforeseen readmissions for a previously known affection. The latter category was submitted to a systematic medical record review to identify the main cause of readmission. Potentially avoidable readmissions were defined as a subgroup of unforeseen readmissions for a previously known affection occurring within an appropriate interval, set to maximize the chance of detecting avoidable readmissions. The computerized screening algorithm was strictly based on routine statistics: diagnosis and procedures coding and admission mode. The prediction was based on a Poisson regression model. There were 454 (13.1\%) unforeseen readmissions for a previously known affection within 1 year. Fifty-nine readmissions (1.7\%) were judged avoidable, most of them occurring within 1 month, which was the interval used to define potentially avoidable readmissions (n = 174, 5.0\%). The intra-sample sensitivity and specificity of the screening algorithm both reached approximately 96\%. Higher risk for potentially avoidable readmission was associated with previous hospitalizations, high comorbidity index, and long length of stay; lower risk was associated with surgery and delivery. The model offers satisfactory predictive performance and a good medical plausibility. The proposed measure could be used as an indicator of inpatient care outcome. However, the instrument should be validated using other sets of data from various hospitals.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The hospital readmission rate has been proposed as an important outcome indicator computable from routine statistics. However, most commonly used measures raise conceptual issues. OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the usefulness of the computerized algorithm for identifying avoidable readmissions on the basis of minimum bias, criterion validity, and measurement precision. RESEARCH DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: A total of 131,809 hospitalizations of patients discharged alive from 49 hospitals were used to compare the predictive performance of risk adjustment methods. A subset of a random sample of 570 medical records of discharge/readmission pairs in 12 hospitals were reviewed to estimate the predictive value of the screening of potentially avoidable readmissions. MEASURES: Potentially avoidable readmissions, defined as readmissions related to a condition of the previous hospitalization and not expected as part of a program of care and occurring within 30 days after the previous discharge, were identified by a computerized algorithm. Unavoidable readmissions were considered as censored events. RESULTS: A total of 5.2\% of hospitalizations were followed by a potentially avoidable readmission, 17\% of them in a different hospital. The predictive value of the screen was 78\%; 27\% of screened readmissions were judged clearly avoidable. The correlation between the hospital rate of clearly avoidable readmission and all readmissions rate, potentially avoidable readmissions rate or the ratio of observed to expected readmissions were respectively 0.42, 0.56 and 0.66. Adjustment models using clinical information performed better. CONCLUSION: Adjusted rates of potentially avoidable readmissions are scientifically sound enough to warrant their inclusion in hospital quality surveillance.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Hospital readmissions of older persons are common and often associated with complex health problems. The objectives were to analyze risk factors for readmission within 30 days from hospital discharge. Methods: A prospective study with a multifactorial approach based on the population-based longitudinal Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA) was conducted. During 9 years of follow-up, information on hospitalizations, readmissions and associated diagnoses were obtained from national registers. Logistic regression models controlling for age and sex were conducted to analyze risk factors for readmissions. Results: Of the 772 participants, [mean age 69.7 (+/- 11.1), 84 (63\%)] were hospitalized and among these 208 (43\%) had one or several readmissions within 30 days during the follow-up period. Most of the readmissions (57\%) occurred within the first week; mean days from hospital discharge to readmission was 7.9 (+/- 6.2). The most common causes of admission and readmission were cardiovascular diseases and tumors. Only 8\% of the readmissions were regarded as avoidable admissions. In a multivariate logistic regression, falling within the last 12 months (OR 0.57, p = 0.039) and being a male (OR 1.84, p = 0.006) increased the risk of readmission. Conclusions: Most older persons that are readmitted return to hospital within the first week after discharge. Experiencing a fall was a particular risk factor of readmission. Preventive actions should preferably take place already at the hospital to reduce the numbers of readmission. Still, it should be remembered that most readmissions were considered to be necessary.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Nutrition screening is an initial procedure in which the risk of malnutrition is identified. The aims of this review were to identify malnutrition risk from nutrition screening studies that have used validated nutrition screening tools in community living older adults; and to identify types of nutrition interventions, pathways of care and patient outcomes following screening. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed for the period from January 1994 until December 2013 using SCOPUS, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, PubMed and COCHRANE databases as well as a manual search. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were determined for the literature searches and the methodology followed the PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Fifty-four articles were eligible to be included in the review and malnutrition risk varied from 0\% to 83\%. This large range was influenced by the different tools used and heterogeneity of study samples. Most of the studies were cross sectional and without a subsequent nutrition intervention component. Types of nutrition intervention that were identified included dietetics care, nutrition education, and referral to Meals on Wheels services and community services. These interventions helped to improve the' nutritional status of older adults. CONCLUSIONS: Timely nutrition screening of older adults living in the community, if followed up with appropriate intervention and monitoring improves the nutritional status of older adults. This indicates that nutrition intervention should be considered a priority following nutrition screening for malnourished and at risk older adults. Further evaluation of outcomes of nutrition screening and associated interventions, using structured pathways of care, is warranted.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent UK antibiotic stewardship policies have resulted in significant changes in primary care dispensing, but whether this has impacted antimicrobial resistance is unknown. AIM: To evaluate associations between changes in primary care dispensing and antimicrobial resistance in community-acquired urinary Escherichia coli infections. METHODS: Multilevel logistic regression modelling investigating relationships between primary care practice level antibiotic dispensing for approximately 1.5 million patients in South West England and resistance in 152,704 community-acquired urinary E. coli between 2013 and 2016. Relationships presented for within and subsequent quarter drug-bug pairs, adjusted for patient age, deprivation, and rurality. RESULTS: In line with national trends, overall antibiotic dispensing per 1000 registered patients fell 11\%. Amoxicillin fell 14\%, cefalexin 20\%, ciprofloxacin 24\%, co-amoxiclav 49\% and trimethoprim 8\%. Nitrofurantoin increased 7\%. Antibiotic reductions were associated with reduced within quarter same-antibiotic resistance to: amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim. Subsequent quarter reduced resistance was observed for trimethoprim and amoxicillin. Antibiotic dispensing reductions were associated with increased within and subsequent quarter resistance to cefalexin and co-amoxiclav. Increased nitrofurantoin dispensing was associated with reduced within and subsequent quarter trimethoprim resistance without affecting nitrofurantoin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation of a national primary care stewardship policy on antimicrobial resistance in the community suggests both hoped-for benefits and unexpected harms. Some increase in resistance to cefalexin and co-amoxiclav could result from residual confounding. Randomised controlled trials are urgently required to investigate causality.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the compliance on hand-hygiene and related factors among healthcare providers working at secondary and tertiary hospitals in Chengdu. METHODS: On-site observations regarding hand-hygiene compliance and facilities were conducted in 6 hospitals in Chengdu. Doctors and nurses were asked and recorded about their knowledge regarding hand-hygiene. RESULTS: Of 1535 activities where hand-hygiene was deemed necessary, under observating healthcare providers would perform hand-hygiene procedures 17.8\% of the time (12.8\% of the time before touching a patient, 21.0\% of the time before touching objects around a patient, 27.3\% of the time after touching a patient, and 31.5\% of the time after removing gloves). Only 2.2\% of the treating rooms were equipped with foot-operated or automatic faucets;of these only 24.5\% had soap or alcohol-based hand-sanitizer, and 6.3\% had paper towel or other hand-drying equipment. 92.8\% of the healthcare providers knew of the six-step method on hand-washing. More than 90.0\% of the healthcare providers knew that both palm and back of the hands as well as the front and back of the fingers should be washed. However, only 22.8\% knew that the hand-washing procedure should last {$\geq$} 15 seconds. Rates on hand hygiene among chief or more senior physicians (14.6\%), attending physicians (9.2\%) and junior doctors (15.6\%), nurses in chief (25.0\%), senior nurses (26.3\%) and junior nurses (20.5\%) showed no significant differences (P {$>$} 0.05). Similarly, scores on related knowledge between chief or senior physicians (12.4 {\textpm} 3.2), attending physicians (13.6 {\textpm} 3.3) and junior doctors (13.4 {\textpm} 2.9), nurses in charge (15.2 {\textpm} 2.0), senior nurses (14.8 {\textpm} 2.1) and junior nurses (14.3 {\textpm} 2.6) also showed no significant differences (P {$>$} 0.05). Rate on hand hygiene among nurses (22.7\%) was significantly higher than that of the doctors (13.6\%). Rate of hand hygiene among 50 - 59 years old healthcare providers (7.4\%) was significantly lower than those of all the other age groups (17.1\% - 25.0\%); rate of female health care providers (19.5\%) was significantly higher than that of males (13.8\%). Similarly, the nurse's knowledge score (14.7 {\textpm} 2.3) was significantly higher than that of the doctors (13.2 {\textpm} 3.1). Among 50 - 59 years old healthcare providers, the rate was (12.2 {\textpm} 3.8) significantly lower than that of 20 - 29 (14.0 {\textpm} 2.6), 30 - 39 (14.3 {\textpm} 2.9) and 40 - 49 year olds (13.8 {\textpm} 2.7). Again, the knowledge score of females (14.5 {\textpm} 2.5) was significantly higher than that of males (12.7 {\textpm} 3.2) (P {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSION: The high-level knowledge on hand-hygiene among healthcare providers in this area did not translate into good practices. Also, most of the hospitals had poor hand-hygiene equipment. We recommend that training and periodic monitoring be conducted, and hand-hygiene equipment be improved to facilitate hand-hygiene practices among healthcare providers.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Decision making in financial and healthcare matters is of critical importance for well-being in old age. Preliminary work suggests racial differences in decision making; however, the factors that drive racial differences in decision making remain unclear. We hypothesized literacy, particularly financial and health literacy, mediates racial differences in decision making. DESIGN: Community-based epidemiologic cohort study. SETTING: Communities in northeastern Illinois. PARTICIPANTS: Nondemented Black participants (N = 138) of the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center Minority Aging Research Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project who completed decision-making and literacy measures were matched to White participants (N = 138) according to age, education, sex, and global cognition using Mahalanobis distance (total N = 276). MEASUREMENTS: All participants completed clinical assessments, a decision-making measure that resembles real-world materials relevant to finance and healthcare, and a financial and health literacy measure. Regression models were used to examine racial differences in decision making and test the hypothesis that literacy mediates this association. In secondary analyses, we examined the impact of literacy in specific domains of decision making (financial and healthcare). RESULTS: In models adjusted for age, education, sex, and global cognition, older Black adults performed lower than older White adults on literacy ({$\beta$} = -8.20; SE = 1.34; 95\% CI = -10.82 to -5.57; P\,{$<$}\,.01) and separately on decision making ({$\beta$} = -.80; SE = .23; 95\% CI = -1.25 to -.34; P\,{$<$}\,.01). However, when decision making was regressed on both race and literacy, the association of race was attenuated and became nonsignificant ({$\beta$} = -.45; SE = .24; 95\% CI = -.93 to .02; P = .06), but literacy remained significantly associated with decision making ({$\beta$} = .04; SE = .01; 95\% CI = .02-.06; P\,{$<$}\,.01). In secondary models, a similar pattern was observed for both financial and healthcare decision making. CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences in decision making are largely mediated by literacy. These findings suggest that efforts to improve literacy may help reduce racial differences in decision making and improve health and well-being for diverse populations.

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to review articles published in 2013 examining drug-related problems in the elderly and comment on their potential impact on clinical practice. To identify articles, we did a systematic search of the English-language literature restricted to those aged 65 + from January 2013 to December 2013 using Medline and Google Scholar and a combination of the following search terms: drug-related problems, medication-related problems, medication errors, suboptimal prescribing, inappropriate prescribing, underutilization, polypharmacy, medication monitoring, medication dispensing, medication administration, medication adherence, adverse drug events, and adverse drug withdrawal events. A manual search of major general medicine and clinical pharmacology journals was also conducted to identify additional articles. A total of 51 articles were identified of which 20 were chosen to highlight. Three were annotated and critiqued and the additional 17 articles were summarized in an appendix. One article reported the results of a randomized controlled trial that showed that a pharmacist intervention successfully reduced suboptimal prescribing in older hospital patients. Another paper from this group previously reported data from the same study showing that the intervention also reduced medication related readmissions to the hospital. An observational study compared the use of two thiazide diuretics in older outpatients. They found that chlorthalidone was more likely to cause hypokalemia than hydrochlorothiazide. Finally, in a randomized controlled trial a pharmacist intervention resulted in the reduction of anticholinergic burden but did result in an improvement in cognition. These studies highlight that medication errors and adverse drug events continue to be important issues for health care professionals caring for older adults.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess whether easy access to medical information of the emergency department's (ED) frequent users would be useful to patient care in the ED and at primary healthcare centres (PHCs), and if resource utilization in the following year would be affected. METHODS: During a 6-month period, frequent users presenting to the ED of Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Sweden, were randomized by the electronic database system into an intervention (n=834) or control group (n=965), the definition being three or more visits in 12 months before the index visit. Printout case notes, from the intervention patients' last three visits, were made accessible to the ED physicians and optionally forwarded to the patient's PHC physician. Usefulness of this enhanced information was measured by questionnaires, whereas healthcare utilization was compiled from the electronic database. RESULTS: The case notes of 59 (7.1\%) intervention patients were forwarded to the respective PHCs. Of these, access to the enhanced patient information was deemed useful in 82\% cases in the ED, versus 76\% in PHCs. The mean number of ED visits in the following year did not differ significantly in the total intervention group as compared with the controls: 4.0 and 3.9, respectively (P=0.49). Nor were there any differences in utilization of other care resources. CONCLUSION: Although only a small subgroup's information was shared, yielding no decrease in overall healthcare utilization, the study indicated benefits of the enhanced information at the respective care level and also had important clinical and organizational implications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Avoidable hospital readmission is a focus of quality improvement efforts. The effectiveness of individual elements of the standard discharge process in reducing rehospitalisation is unknown. METHODS The authors conducted a case-control study of 1039 patients experiencing rehospitalisation within 30 days of discharge and 981 non-rehospitalised patients matched on admission diagnosis, discharge disposition, and severity of illness. In separate models for each discharge process component, the authors measured the relationship between readmission and discharge summary completion, contents of discharge summary, completion of discharge instructions, contents of discharge instructions, presence of caregiver for discharge instruction, completion of medication reconciliation, and arrangement of ambulatory follow-up prior to discharge. RESULTS Adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, including severity of illness and discharge disposition, the study failed to find an association between readmission and most components of the discharge process. There was no association between readmission and medication reconciliation, transmission of discharge summary to an outpatient physician, or documentation of any specific aspect of discharge instruction. Associations were found between readmission and discharge with followup arranged (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.21; 95\% CI 1.05 to 1.37) and increasing number of medicines (adjusted OR 1.02; 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.04). CONCLUSIONS Documentation of discharge process components in the medical record may not reflect actual discharge process activities. Alternatively, mandated discharge processes are ineffective in preventing readmission. The observed absence of an association between discharge documentation and readmission indicates that discharge quality improvement initiatives should target metrics of discharge process quality beyond improving rates of documentation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Recurrent hospitalizations are responsible for considerable health care spending, although prior studies have shown that a substantial proportion of readmissions are preventable through effective discharge planning and patient follow-up after the initial hospital visit. This retrospective cohort study was undertaken to determine whether telephonic outreach to ensure patient understanding of and adherence to discharge orders following a hospitalization is effective at reducing hospital readmissions within 30 days after discharge. Claims data were analyzed from 30,272 members of a commercial health plan who were discharged from a hospital in 2008 to determine the impact of telephonic intervention on the reduction of 30-day readmissions. Members who received a telephone call within 14 days of discharge and were not readmitted prior to that call comprised the intervention group; all other members formed the comparison group. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the impact of the intervention on 30-day readmissions, after adjusting for covariates. Results demonstrated that older age, male sex, and increased initial hospitalization length of stay were associated with an increased likelihood of readmission (P {$<$} 0.001). Receipt of a discharge call was associated with reduced rates of readmission; intervention group members were 23.1\% less likely than the comparison group to be readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge (P = 0.043). These findings indicate that timely discharge follow-up by telephone to supplement standard care is effective at reducing near-term hospital readmissions and, thus, provides a means of reducing costs for health plans and their members.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several care transition interventions propose that post-discharge phone calls can reduce adverse events and decrease costly return visits to the hospital. However, given the multi-faceted nature of most care transitions interventions, the true relationship between post-discharge phone calls and readmissions in a real world setting is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of receiving a post-discharge telephone call on all-cause 30-day readmission in a general medicine population. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients discharged home from the Medicine Service at a tertiary care academic medical center between November 2010 and May 2012. INTERVENTION: Patients received two telephone call attempts by a nurse within 72 h of discharge. Nurses followed a standard script to address issues associated with readmission. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Billing data captured readmissions. We used logistic regression-adjusted patient and clinical covariates as well as a propensity score representing likelihood of being called to determine the association between call receipt and risk for readmission. KEY RESULTS: There were 5,507 eligible patients. In unadjusted analyses, patients who received a call and completed the intervention were significantly less likely to be readmitted compared to those who did not [155 (5.8 \%) vs 123 (8.6 \%), p\,{$<$}\,0.01]. In multivariable models adjusting for socio-demographic and clinical covariates alone, completing a post-discharge telephone call intervention was associated with lower odds for readmission (AOR 0.71; 95 \% CI: 0.55--0.91). However, when models adjusted for the likelihood of receiving the phone call using the propensity score, no association between call receipt and readmission was observed (AOR 0.91; 95\%CI: 0.69--1.20). CONCLUSIONS: Effectiveness of post-discharge phone call programs may be more related to whether patients are able to answer a phone call than to the care delivered by the phone call. Programs would benefit from improving their ability to perform phone outreach while simultaneously improving on the care delivered during the calls.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of mortality worldwide, with most deaths occurring in low-income countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) '5  Moments for Hand Hygiene' poster has been used to reduce hospital-acquired  infections, but there is no similar tool to prevent community-acquired newborn  infections in low-resource settings. This assessment, part of the BabyGel Pilot  study, evaluated the acceptability of the 'Newborn Moments for Hand Hygiene in  the Home' poster. This was an educational tool which aimed to remind mothers in  rural Uganda to clean their hands to prevent neonatal infection. METHODS: The  BabyGel pilot was a cluster randomised trial that assessed the post-partum use of  alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) to prevent neonatal infections in Mbale, Uganda.  Fifty-five women in 5 village clusters received the ABHR and used it from birth  to 3\,months postnatally, with use guided by the new poster. Following the study,  5 focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted consisting of 6-8 purposively  sampled participants from intervention villages. FGDs were audio-recorded,  transcribed then translated into English. Transcripts were inductively coded  using ATLAS.ti{\textregistered} and qualitatively analysed using thematic content analysis.  RESULTS: Most mothers reported that they understood the message in the poster  ("The picture shows me you must use these drugs to keep your baby healthy") and  that they could adhere to the moments from the poster. Some participants used the  information from the poster to encourage other caregivers to use the ABHR ("after  explaining to them, they liked it"). Other potential moments for hand hygiene  were introduced by participants, such as after tending to domestic animals and  gardening. CONCLUSION: The poster was well-received, and participants reported  compliance with the moments for hand hygiene (although the full body wipe of the  baby has since been removed). The poster will be adapted into a sticker format on  the ABHR bottle. More focus could be put into an education tool for other  caregivers who wish to hold the baby. Overall, the study demonstrated the  acceptability of an adapted version of the WHO Moments for Hand Hygiene poster in  the introduction of an intervention in the community.

For behavioural change to occur, individuals need to perceive the issue as important to them and feel able to make a valuable contribution. Public campaigns have, so far, not been informed by detailed understanding of public attitudes to the problem. We therefore set out to explore the attitudes of members of the public to bacterial resistance.A qualitative grounded theory interview study was undertaken. A purposive maximum variation sample included 32 (70\%) women and 14 (30\%) men, aged from 18 to 89 years, from areas of high, average and low deprivation.Participants were uncertain about bacterial resistance and their explanations were generally incongruent with prevailing biomedical concepts. Perceived importance and personal threat were low. The media was the main information source and it left the impression that dirty hospitals are the main cause. Some participants dreaded hospitalization because they feared resistant infections. Few recognized resistant infections as a problem in the community. Less than a quarter indicated that they could positively influence the situation by expecting antibiotic prescriptions less often, or taking antibiotics according to instructions, and even fewer through their own hand washing behaviour.Although members of the public can contribute to containing bacterial resistance, most do not feel that they have a personal role in either the problem or its solution. Campaigns should identify bacterial resistance as both a hospital and a community problem that individuals have the power to influence through specific actions.}

PARTICIPANTS: Individuals reaching the age of 100 between 1990 and 2013 (N = 11,084; n = 8,982 women, n = 2,102 men). MEASUREMENTS: Main drug classes prescribed and potentially inappropriate prescribing according to the 2012 American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria. RESULTS: At the age of 100, 73\% of individuals (79\% of women, 54\% of men) had received one or more prescription drugs, with a median of 7 (interquartile range 0-12) prescription items. The most frequently prescribed drug classes were cardiovascular (53\%), central nervous system (CNS) (53\%), and gastrointestinal (47\%). Overall, 32\% of participants (28\% of men, 32\% of women) who received drug prescriptions may have received one or more potentially inappropriate prescriptions, with temazepam and amitriptyline being the most frequent. CNS prescriptions were potentially inappropriate in 23\% of individuals, and anticholinergic prescriptions were potentially inappropriate in 18\% of individuals. CONCLUSION: The majority of centenarians are prescribed one or more drug therapies, and the prescription may be inappropriate for up to one-third of these individuals.

Unlike random zeroes (responses that can be greater than zero, but are zero due to sampling variability), structural zeroes are usually very different, both statistically and clinically. False interpretations of results and study findings may result if differences in the two types of zeroes are ignored. However, in practice, the status of the structural zeroes is often not observed and this latent nature complicates the data analysis.

  abstract = {Summary Background The increasing burden of multimorbidity and its socioeconomic gradient poses unique challenges to the provision and structure of health care. We aimed to describe inequalities and trends over time in multimorbidity prevalence, incidence, and case fatality among adults of all ages in England using primary care electronic health records. Methods We used a random sample of 991\,243 individuals from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum database registered at participating general practices within England between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2019, linked to the 2015 English Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). We used the following two outcome measures: basic multimorbidity, comprising two or more chronic conditions; and complex multimorbidity, comprising at least three chronic conditions affecting at least three body systems. We calculated crude, age-standardised, and age--sex-standardised annual incidence, prevalence, and case fatality rates, along with median age of onset for both multimorbidity types. We calculated absolute and relative inequalities for each outcome. Findings In 2004, 30{$\cdot$}8\% of our study population had basic multimorbidity and 15{$\cdot$}1\% had complex multimorbidity. This increased to 52{$\cdot$}8\% and 32{$\cdot$}7\%, respectively, in 2019. Although the overall incidence of basic multimorbidity remained stable over the 16-year study period, the incidence among people of working age and the incidence of complex multimorbidity increased gradually. Socioeconomic deprivation was associated with an increased incidence of both multimorbidity types in working-age adults. The median age at onset of complex multimorbidity was 7 years younger for the most deprived quintile of the IMD compared with the least deprived quintile. Interpretation The burden of multimorbidity in England has increased substantially over the past 16 years with persistent inequalities, which are worse in working-age adults and for complex multimorbidity. Prevention efforts to reduce the onset and slow the progression of multimorbidity are essential to reduce the increasing impact on patients and health systems alike.

  abstract = {Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus (GBS)) is the leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in many countries. Intrapartum antibiotic  strategies have reduced the incidence of early-onset neonatal GBS in a number of  countries but have had no impact on late onset GBS infection (LOD). In low/middle  income settings, the disease burden remains uncertain although in several  countries of Southern Africa appears comparable to or higher than that of  high-income countries. As disease may be rapidly fulminating cases can be missed  before appropriate samples are obtained and this may lead to underestimation of  the true burden. Given the rapid onset and progression within hours of birth as  well as the deficiencies in IAP strategies and absence of a solution for  preventing LOD, it is clear that administration of a suitable vaccine in  pregnancy could provide a better solution in all settings; it should also be cost  effective. The current leading vaccine candidates are CPS-protein conjugate  vaccines but protein-based vaccines are also in development and one has recently  commenced clinical trials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hospital readmissions are increasingly used to pay hospitals differently. We hypothesized that readmission rates, readmissions related to index admission, and potentially unnecessary readmissions vary by data collection method for surgical patients. STUDY DESIGN: Using 3 different data collection methods, we compared 30-day unplanned readmission rates and potentially unnecessary readmissions among colorectal surgery patients at a single institution between July 2009 and November 2011. We compared the NSQIP clinical reviewer method, the University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC) administrative billing data method, and physician medical record review. RESULTS: Seven hundred and thirty-five colorectal surgery patients were identified with readmission rates as follows: NSQIP 14.6\% (107 of 735) vs UHC 17.6\% (129 of 735). The NSQIP method identified 9 readmissions not found in billing records because the readmission occurred at another hospital (n~= 7) or due to a discrepancy in definition (n~= 2). The UHC method identified 31 readmissions not identified by NSQIP because of a broader readmission definition (n~= 20) or were missed by reviewers (n~= 11). The NSQIP method identified 72\% of readmissions as related to index admission and physician chart review identified 83\%. The UHC method identified 51\% of readmissions as related to index admission and physician chart review identified 86\%. Sixty-six of 129 UHC readmissions (51\%) were deemed potentially preventable; based on physician chart review, 112 of 129 readmissions (87\%) were deemed clinically necessary at the time of presentation. Most readmissions were due to surgical site infections (46 of 129 [36\%]) and dehydration (30 of 129 [23\%]). With improved patient-care efforts, 41 of 129 (31.8\%) complications might not have required readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Readmission rates and unnecessary readmissions vary depending on data collection methodology. Reimbursements based on readmission should use standardized and fair methods to minimize perverse incentives that penalize hospitals for appropriate care of high-risk surgical patients.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the utility of a telephone outcall program for cancer caregivers and to examine longitudinal changes in their distress levels and supportive care needs. METHODS: As part of the PROTECT trial, caregivers assigned to the intervention arm (N\,=\,108) received three telephone outcalls from a Cancer Council 13 11 20 nurse at three time points (7-10~days post-randomization, 1 and 4~months later). During each call, caregivers were screened for distress using the Distress Thermometer (range: 0-10) then six supportive care issues were raised for discussion. Participants completed a utility survey 1~month post-intervention. RESULTS: The outcall program was highly acceptable and perceived as beneficial by caregivers. Overall, 95\% reported it was worth their time to take part in the outcall program and 82\% stated that the program was very relevant to them. Level of distress and impact of distress decreased over time (p\,=\,0.0031, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001, respectively). Average call duration decreased over time (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) and was longer for female than male caregivers (p\,=\,0.0009). The frequency of caregivers discussing issues related to psychological distress (p\,=\,0.0003), health literacy (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001), financial (p\,=\,0.0014), and practical concerns (p\,=\,0.0121) decreased over time. Psychological distress was more often discussed by female than male caregivers (p\,=\,0.0153), and family issues more often by younger ({$<$}\,55~years) than older caregivers (p\,=\,0.0071). CONCLUSIONS: Utility of this outcall program was high. Caregivers' level of distress and unmet needs decreased over time. Gender and age differences emerged, which warrants the need for tailored support. Further research is necessary to identify the best method of improving access to 13 11 20 services for caregivers.},

METHODS: Self-report questionnaires were sent to a nationwide sample of 1.341 chronic disease patients. The Dutch Functional Communicative and Critical Health Literacy scale (FCCHL), the Partners in Health scale (PIH) and Perceived Efficacy in Patient-Doctor Interactions (PEPPI-5) were used to assess health literacy and aspects of self-management. RESULTS: In general, health literacy skills were good. A higher age, lower education, lower income, multi-morbidity and/or functional limitations were associated with lower levels of health literacy. Communicative and critical health literacy were related to some aspects of self-management but not to all. Functional health literacy was less important. CONCLUSION: Communicative and critical health literacy play a role in successful self-management of chronic disease but the impact differs by context. Health literacy levels vary according to socio-demographic and disease characteristics of patients. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health care professionals should tailor their information and support to the health literacy skills and personal context of their patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are common in elderly patients. There are various reasons for this, including age- and disease-related alterations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the common practice of polypharmacy. The decline in renal function in elderly patients may also predispose them to pharmacological ADRs (type A, augmented). Patients receiving home healthcare may be at even higher risk. OBJECTIVES: To study ADRs as a cause of acute hospital admissions in a defined cohort of elderly patients (aged {$>$}or=65 years) registered to receive home healthcare services, with special reference to impaired renal function as a possible risk factor. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 154 elderly patients aged {$>$}or=65 years admitted to the emergency department of a university hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, in October-November 2002. Estimated creatinine clearance (eCL(CR)) was calculated from the Cockcroft-Gault formula, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. ADRs were defined according to WHO criteria. All medications administered to patients at admission and at discharge were collated. These and other data were collected from computerized hospital records. RESULTS: ADRs were judged to contribute to or be the primary cause of hospitalization in 22 patients, i.e. 14\% of 154 patients registered to receive home healthcare. Eleven of the 22 patients were women. All but one ADR were type A. Excessive doses or drugs unsuitable in renal insufficiency were present in seven patients in the ADR group compared with only four patients in the group without ADRs (p = 0.0001). Patients with ADRs did not differ significantly from those without ADRs in relation to age, plasma creatinine, eCL(CR), weight or number of drugs prescribed at admission. However, women with ADRs were significantly older than women without ADRs (mean +/- SD age 88.8 +/- 5.7 years vs 82.5 +/- 8.0 years, respectively; p = 0.014) and had significantly lower mean +/- SD eCL(CR) values (25.5 +/- 10.8 and 37.1 +/- 17.1 mL/min, respectively; p = 0.035). Median MDRD eGFR was significantly higher than median eCL(CR) (59 [range 6-172] mL/min/1.73 m2 vs 38 [range 5-117] mL/min, respectively; p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients registered to receive home healthcare, 14\% of hospital admissions were primarily caused by ADRs. One-third of these ADRs were related to impaired renal function, generally in very old women. These ADRs may be avoided by close monitoring of renal function and adjustments to pharmacotherapy (drug selection and dose), particularly in very elderly women.},

  abstract = {Globally, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious problem causing 700,000 deaths annually. By 2050, AMR is expected to cause approximately 10 million deaths globally each year if allowed to increase at the present rate. Many individuals have limited knowledge regarding appropriate antibiotic use and AMR. Most antibiotic use occurs in the outpatient setting, with approximately 30\% of antibiotics prescribed deemed unnecessary. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is a means to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and AMR. While existing AMS efforts generally focus on the inpatient setting, a significant gap is present in the outpatient setting. A common theme across various national action plans to reduce AMR is the need for education and awareness. The importance of communicating information in a manner easily comprehended by the patient in addition to productive clinician--patient dialogue cannot be overestimated. Enhancing the public's and patients' AMS health literacy is an underrecognized approach to help address AMR. We describe Four Core Elements of Enhancing AMS Health Literacy in the Outpatient Setting, utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's framework: (1) leadership commitment, (2) intervention/action, (3) tracking/reporting, and (4) education/expertise. We call upon leaders in outpatient settings to embrace this approach to curb inappropriate antimicrobial use.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A potential link between the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine and an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been evaluated in several studies, but some of them have substantial methodologic limitations. METHODS: The authors conducted a nested case-control study within the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) in the United Kingdom. The authors identified patients who had a first MS diagnosis recorded in the GPRD between January 1993 and December 2000. Cases were patients with a diagnosis of MS confirmed through examination of medical records, and with at least 3 years of continuous recording in the GPRD before their date of first symptoms (index date). Up to 10 controls per case were randomly selected, matched on age, sex, practice, and date of joining the practice. Information on receipt of immunizations was obtained from the computer records. RESULTS: The analyses include 163 cases of MS and 1,604 controls. The OR of MS for vaccination within 3 years before the index date compared to no vaccination was 3.1 (95\% CI 1.5, 6.3). No increased risk of MS was associated with tetanus and influenza vaccinations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that immunization with the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine is associated with an increased risk of MS, and challenge the idea that the relation between hepatitis B vaccination and risk of MS is well understood.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The hand hygiene (HH) is one of the preventive practices more .widely and effectively implemented in the control of healthcare associated infections. However, there are several barriers to compliance. OBJECTIVES: To assess which strategy, state-of-the-art strategies (availability of alcohol-based preparations, posters, instructions and training) or extended strategies (feedbacks, formal and informal leadership), are seen as more effective to improve hand hygiene (HH) compliance. METHODS: Analytical study using a self-completed questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization. 2,068 questionnaires, completed by healthcare professionals (HP) in Andalusia (Spain), were received from 2010 to 2012. Analytical technique: Structural equation modeling and multi group measurement invariance. RESULTS: Once the reliability of the proposed constructs was achieved (Cronbach alpha=0.73, 0.84, 0.70), it was found that those HP working in centers with the highest level of commitment with HH are those who see extended strategies as more effective (chi2=298.3, df=39, CFI=0.972, TLI=0.961, RMSEA=0.057, SRMR=0.028). DISCUSSION: Our results have shown that hospitals' HP, compared to primary care HP, see state-of-the-art strategies as more effective, as well as they give less importance to HH, meanwhile nurses, compared to physicians, see effective both strategies. HP contemplate the combination of state-of-the-art and extended strategies as an effective way to improve the HH compliance. In addition, extended strategies are considered more effective amongst the most "advanced" healthcare settings in terms of their commitment to HH. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the need for commitment at management, collective and individual level in order to maintain patient safety.},

We linked these to publicly available county data from the Area Resource File, the Census, Nursing Home Compare, and the Neilsen PopFacts datasets. Study Design: We used hierarchical linear models to assess the effect of county demographic, access to care, and nursing home quality characteristics on the pooled 30-day risk-standardized readmission rate. Data Collection/Extraction Methods:Not applicable. Principal Findings: The study sample included 4,073 hospitals. Fifty-eight percent of national variation in hospital readmission rates was explained by the county in which the hospital was located. In multivariable analysis, a number of county characteristics were found to be independently associated with higher readmission rates, the strongest associations being for measures of access to care. These county characteristics explained almost half of the total variation across counties. Conclusions: Community factors, as measured by county characteristics, explain a substantial amount of variation in hospital readmission rates.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a growing impetus to reorganize the hospital discharge process to reduce avoidable readmissions and costs. The aim of this study was to provide insight into hospital discharge problems and underlying causes, and to give an overview of solutions that guide providers and policy-makers in improving hospital discharge. METHODS: The Intervention Mapping framework was used. First, a problem analysis studying the scale, causes, and consequences of ineffective hospital discharge was carried out. The analysis was based on primary data from 26 focus group interviews and 321 individual interviews with patients and relatives, and involved hospital and community care providers. Second, improvements in terms of intervention outcomes, performance objectives and change objectives were specified. Third, 220 experts were consulted and a systematic review of effective discharge interventions was carried out to select theory-based methods and practical strategies required to achieve change and better performance. RESULTS: Ineffective discharge is related to factors at the level of the individual care provider, the patient, the relationship between providers, and the organisational and technical support for care providers. Providers can reduce hospital readmission rates and adverse events by focusing on high-quality discharge information, well-coordinated care, and direct and timely communication with their counterpart colleagues. Patients, or their carers, should participate in the discharge process and be well aware of their health status and treatment. Assessment by hospital care providers whether discharge information is accurate and understood by patients and their community counterparts, are important examples of overcoming identified barriers to effective discharge. Discharge templates, medication reconciliation, a liaison nurse or pharmacist, regular site visits and teach-back are identified as effective and promising strategies to achieve the desired behavioural and environmental change. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comprehensive guiding framework for providers and policy-makers to improve patient handover from hospital to primary care.}

Care transition management programs address chronic disease complexity to reduce unnecessary hospitalization, improve quality of care, and reduce medical expense. This report describes how informatics influenced the transformation of a regional managed care organization from one focused on specific chronic disease prevalence to one targeting population-specific chronic conditions based on complexity. The key implication of these results is that population-based informatics can amplify the impact of programs designed to improve quality and prevent avoidable admissions and, at the same time, speed the rate of translation of evidence-based interventions to entire populations. This approach demonstrated an effective, efficient way to translate evidence-based research to the Medicare population, smoothing the transition back into the community, and preventing avoidable hospital admissions.},

METHOD: The Reported Edmonton Frail Scale (REFS) was adapted from the Edmonton Frail Scale for use with Australian acute inpatients. With acute patients aged over 70 years admitted to an Australian teaching hospital, we validated REFS against the Geriatrician's Clinical Impression of Frailty (GCIF), measures of cognition, comorbidity and function, and assessed inter-rater reliability. RESULTS: REFS was moderately correlated with GCIF (n = 105, R = 0.61, P {$<$} 0.01), Mini-Mental State Examination impairment (n = 61, R = 0.49, P {$<$} 0.001), Charlson Comorbidity Index (n = 59, R = 0.51, P {$<$} 0.001) and Katz Daily Living Scale (n = 59, R = 0.51, P {$<$} 0.001). Inter-rater reliability of REFS administered by two researchers without medical training was excellent (kappa = 0.84, n = 31). CONCLUSION: In this cohort of older acute inpatients, REFS is a valid, reliable test of frailty, and may be a valuable research tool to assess the impact of frailty on prognosis and response to therapy.},

The multiple regression model explained 13.9\% of variance in knowledge of breast cancer genetics (p\,=\,0.03). Best fit of the multiple regression model included all variables except education. Reported amount of information shared was the only independently significant factor associated with knowledge ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.28, p\,=\,0.01). Participants who reported higher levels of information shared by a family member about information learned during a genetic counseling session also demonstrated increased knowledge about breast cancer genetics.},

  abstract = {Background: Social capital has been related to a number of important public health variables such as child welfare, mortality, and health status. However, the relation of social capital to infectious diseases has received relatively little attention. The relation of social capital to health measures is often posited to be related to the key societal variables of poverty and income inequality. Therefore, any exploration of the correlation between social capital and infectious diseases should also include examination of the association with poverty and income inequality. Objective: This study examined the state level association between social capital, poverty, income inequality, and four infectious diseases that have important public health implications given their long term sequelae: gonorrhoea, syphilis, chlamydia, and AIDS. Method: A state level, correlational analysis (including bivariate linear correlational analysis, and multivariate linear stepwise regression analysis) was carried out. 1999 state level rates of gonorrhoea, syphilis, chlamydia, and AIDS were the main outcome measures. Results: In bivariate analyses, poverty was significantly correlated with chlamydia; income inequality was significantly correlated with chlamydia and AIDS case rates; and social capital was significantly correlated with all outcome measures. In stepwise multiple regression analyses, social capital was always the strongest predictor variable. Conclusions: These results suggest that social capital is highly predictive of at least some infectious diseases. The results indicate the need for further research into this relation, and suggest the potential need for structural interventions designed to increase social capital in communities.},

This review aims to critically discuss the extant literature on help-seeking and mental health service utilization among individuals at elevated risk for suicide, as well as to outline challenges and future directions for research in this area. Across studies, the rate of mental health service use for those with past-year suicide ideation, plans, and/or attempts was approximately 29.5\% based on weighted averages, with a lack of perceived need for services, preference for self-management, fear of hospitalization, and structural factors (e.g., time, finances) identified as key barriers to care. Studies also revealed facilitators to care, which include mental health literacy, positive views of services, and encouragement from family or friends to seek support. To address these low rates of help-seeking and barriers to care, a number of interventions have been developed, including psychoeducation-based programs, peer and gatekeeper training, and screening-based approaches. Despite these efforts, it appears that work is still needed to gauge the impact of these interventions on behavioral outcomes and to more rigorously test their effectiveness. Additional implications for future research on help-seeking among suicidal individuals are discussed.},

Owing  to limited diagnostic capacity and unawareness, the data on human leptospirosis  particularly in neonates are scarce in many sub-Saharan countries. It has been  underreported hindering preventive and control measures in place. The study aimed  at determining prevalence of leptospirosis as a cause of febrile illness in  neonates using IgM ELISA and a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). METHODS: This  was a descriptive cross-sectional study that included 103 neonatal sepsis cases  whose parents/legal guardians gave informed consent. The data on demographic and  clinical characteristics were collected using structured data collection form.  EDTA whole blood sample was collected from the neonates by trained study nurses.  From the samples, IgM ELISA was done using automated analyzers, DNA extracted and  qPCR was performed using primers for LipL32, specific for the pathogenic  leptospires. RESULTS: The prevalence of anti-leptospiral IgM among the neonates  as determined by ELISA was 4.3\%, where all of them presented with lethargy and  poor feeding. No pathogenic Leptospira species DNA was amplified by qPCR.  CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of leptospirosis was demonstrated in neonatal sepsis cases  in this study. The findings suggest considerations of leptospirosis in the  differential diagnosis of neonates with sepsis. More data are needed on the real  epidemiology, clinical features, and burden of leptospirosis in neonates. There  is need to include intermediate pathogenic species of Leptospira in the  diagnostic qPCR assays.},

METHODS: All patients diagnosed with one or more chronic diseases in 2008-2009 (N=17,443) were selected from the nationwide NIVEL Primary Care Database, and data on their GP contacts were included. Data on hospital admissions (from the Dutch Hospital Data database) and household size and income (from the Integral Household Incomes database 2010) were added. Chi-square-tests and multivariate regression analyses were performed to test for differences between multimorbid patients and patients with one chronic disease, and between subgroups of multimorbid patients derived from cluster analysis. RESULTS: Multimorbid patients (40\% of the total sample) had more GP contacts, prescribed medications, and hospital admissions (all p{$<$}.0001) than patients with one chronic disease. The largest cluster of multimorbid patients (80\%) was characterized by a relatively low level of health care utilization. Two smaller clusters comprised patients with a (very) high level of health care utilization - these people were mainly older, more often female, had a lower income, a smaller household size, and suffered from more chronic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Among the vast majority of multimorbid patients health care utilization is only slightly higher compared to patients with one chronic disease. Extensive health care utilization among people with multimorbidity seems to be related to patient characteristics as well as illness characteristics.},

METHODS Systematic search in six electronic databases for scientific papers published between January 2011 and March 2014, supplemented by reference tracking. Wagner's Chronic Care Model (CCM) was used to operationalize comprehensive care. The quality of the included studies was assessed, and a best-evidence synthesis was applied. RESULTS Nineteen publications were included describing effects of eighteen comprehensive care programs for multimorbid or frail patients, of which only one was implemented in a European country. Programs varied in target groups, settings, interventions and number of CCM components addressed. Providing comprehensive care might result in more patient satisfaction, less depressive symptoms, a better health-related quality of life or functioning of multimorbid or frail patients, but the evidence is insufficient. There is no evidence that comprehensive care reduces the number of primary care or GP visits or healthcare costs. Regarding the use of inpatient care, the evidence was insufficient. No evidence was found for a beneficial effect of comprehensive care on caregiver-related outcomes. CONCLUSION Despite the fact that over the years several (good-quality) studies have been performed to estimate the value of comprehensive care for multimorbid and/or frail patients, evidence for their effectiveness remains insufficient. More good-quality studies and/or studies allowing meta-analysis are needed to determine which specific target groups at what moment will benefit from comprehensive care. Moreover, evaluation studies could improve by using more appropriate outcome measures, e.g. measures that relate to patient-defined (personal) goals of care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over a quarter of Medicare patients admitted to the hospital are discharged to post-acute care (PAC) facilities, but face high rates of readmission. Timing of readmission may be an important factor in identifying both risk for and preventability of future readmissions. This study aims to define factors associated with readmission within the first week of discharge to PAC facilities following hospitalization. DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: This was a secondary analysis of the 2011 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases (SID) for California, Massachusetts, and Florida. The primary outcome was all-cause readmission within 7 days after hospital discharge, compared to readmission on days 8-30, for patients aged 65 and older who were discharged from the hospital to a PAC facility. Predictor variables included patient, index hospitalization, and hospital characteristics; multivariable logistic regression was used to identify significant predictors of readmission within 7 days. RESULTS: There were 81,173 hospital readmissions from PAC facilities in the first 30 days after hospital discharge. Patients readmitted within the first week were older, white, urban, had fewer comorbid illnesses, had a higher number of previous hospital admissions, and less commonly had Medicare as a payer. Longer index hospital length of stay (LOS) was associated with decreased risk of early readmission (OR 0.74; 95\% CI 0.70-0.74 for LOS 4-7 days and 0.60; 95\% CI 0.56-0.64 for LOS {$>$}/=8 days). CONCLUSIONS: Shorter length of index hospital stay is associated with earlier readmission and suggests that for this comorbid, older population, a shorter hospital stay may be detrimental. Readmission after 1 week is associated with increased chronic disease burden, suggesting they may be associated with factors that are less modifiable.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Existing publicly reported readmission measures are condition-specific, representing less than 20\% of adult hospitalizations. An all-condition measure may better measure quality and promote innovation. OBJECTIVE: To develop an all-condition, hospital-wide readmission measure. DESIGN: Measure development study. SETTING: 4821 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years or older. MEASUREMENTS: Hospital-level, risk-standardized unplanned readmissions within 30 days of discharge. The measure uses Medicare fee-for-service claims and is a composite of 5 specialty-based, risk-standardized rates for medicine, surgery/gynecology, cardiorespiratory, cardiovascular, and neurology cohorts. The 2007-2008 admissions were randomly split for development and validation. Models were adjusted for age, principal diagnosis, and comorbid conditions. Calibration in Medicare and all-payer data was examined, and hospital rankings in the development and validation samples were compared. RESULTS: The development data set contained 8~018~949 admissions associated with 1~276~165 unplanned readmissions (15.9\%). The median hospital risk-standardized unplanned readmission rate was 15.8 (range, 11.6 to 21.9). The 5 specialty cohort models accurately predicted readmission risk in both Medicare and all-payer data sets for average-risk patients but slightly overestimated readmission risk at the extremes. Overall hospital risk-standardized readmission rates did not differ statistically in the split samples (P~= 0.71 for difference in rank), and 76\% of hospitals' validation-set rankings were within 2 deciles of the development rank (24\% were more than 2 deciles). Of hospitals ranking in the top or bottom deciles, 90\% remained within 2 deciles (10\% were more than 2 deciles) and 82\% remained within 1 decile (18\% were more than 1 decile). LIMITATION: Risk adjustment was limited to that available in claims data. CONCLUSION: A claims-based, hospital-wide unplanned readmission measure for profiling hospitals produced reasonably consistent results in different data sets and was similarly calibrated in both Medicare and all-payer data.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health literacy (HL) enables patients with breast cancer to actively participate in health decisions and promote positive health outcomes. The Integrated Model of Health Literacy (IMHL), defined as the personal, situational, and societal/environmental factors that predict the level of HL that can influence health outcomes, incorporates the concepts, determinants, and consequences of HL. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the mechanisms and completeness of the IMHL in patients with breast cancer. METHODS: Five hundred eleven Taiwanese patients were prospectively recruited. We conducted structural equation modeling to confirm and modify the predictive pathways linking the HL-related factors in the IMHL. RESULTS: Results on a total of 511 breast cancer patients showed good model-data fit. An alternative model revealed better fit with 2 pathways added from cancer stage to self-rated health and from cancer duration to shared decision making. Both the original model and alternative model modification revealed that only personal determinants (age, education, cancer stage, and duration) and not situational determinants (marital status) or social/environmental determinants (residence and occupation) could significantly predict the 3 domains of HL. Theorized consequences of HL were significantly influenced by HL in both models. CONCLUSIONS: Our results partially support the relationships proposed in the IMHL for patients with breast cancer as only personal determinants significantly predicted HL. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Understanding the predictive pathways of the integrated HL model could help clinicians to tailor HL interventions using a patient's personal determinants to facilitate participation in decision making and promote health for breast cancer patients.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the impact of low health literacy on medical care use and costs. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 3260 noninstitutionalized elderly persons enrolling in a Medicare managed care plan in 1997 in Cleveland, Ohio; Houston, Texas; South Florida; and Tampa, Florida. Health literacy--the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions--was measured using the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. We used a 2-part regression model to examine the association between health literacy and medical costs, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, alcohol and tobacco consumption, and comorbid conditions. Results are presented as mean differences (with 95\% confidence intervals [CI]) between the inadequate and adequate groups and, separately, the marginal and adequate groups. RESULTS: When compared to those with adequate health literacy, emergency room costs were significantly higher (\$108; 95\% CI: \$62 to \$154; P {$<$}0.0001) among those with inadequate health literacy, while differences in total (\$1551; 95\% CI: -\$166 to \$3267; P = 0.08) and inpatient (\$1543; 95\% CI: -\$89 to \$3175; P = 0.06) costs were marginally significant. Total costs were higher in the marginal health literacy group, but the difference was not significant (\$596; 95\% CI: -\$1437 to \$2630; P = 0.57). CONCLUSIONS: Persons with inadequate health literacy incur higher medical costs and use an inefficient mix of services.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Differences in health literacy levels by race and education are widely hypothesized to contribute to health disparities, but there is little direct evidence. OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which low health literacy exacerbates differences between racial and socioeconomic groups in terms of health status and receipt of vaccinations. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS (OR PATIENTS OR SUBJECTS): Three thousand two hundred and sixty noninstitutionalized elderly persons enrolling in a Medicare managed care plan in 1997 in Cleveland, OH; Houston, TX; South Florida; and Tampa, FL. MEASUREMENTS: Dependent variables were physical health SF-12 score, mental health SF-12 score, self-reported health status, receipt of influenza vaccine, and receipt of pneumococcal vaccine. Independent variables included health literacy, educational attainment, race, income, age, sex, chronic health conditions, and smoking status. RESULTS: After adjusting for demographic and health-related variables, individuals without a high school education had worse physical and mental health and worse self-reported health status than those with a high school degree. Accounting for health literacy reduced these differences by 22\% to 41\%. Black individuals had worse self-reported health status and lower influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates. Accounting for health literacy reduced the observed difference in self-reported health by 25\% but did not affect differences in vaccination rates. CONCLUSIONS: We found that health literacy explained a small to moderate fraction of the differences in health status and, to a lesser degree, receipt of vaccinations that would normally be attributed to educational attainment and/or race if literacy was not considered.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a condition resulting in an increased risk of skeletal fractures due to a reduction in the density of bone tissue. Treatment of osteoporosis typically involves the use of pharmacological agents. In general it is thought that disuse (prolonged periods of inactivity) and unloading of the skeleton promotes reduced bone mass, whereas mechanical loading through exercise increases bone mass. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of exercise interventions in preventing bone loss and fractures in postmenopausal women. SEARCH STRATEGY: During the update of this review we updated the original search strategy by searching up to December 2010 the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group's Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2010 Issue 12); MEDLINE; EMBASE; HealthSTAR; Sports Discus; CINAHL; PEDro; Web of Science; Controlled Clinical Trials; and AMED. We attempted to identify other studies by contacting experts, searching reference lists and searching trial registers. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our predetermined inclusion criteria. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Pairs of members of the review team extracted the data and assessed trial quality using predetermined forms. For dichotomous outcomes (fractures), we calculated risk ratios (RRs) using a fixed-effect model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MDs) of the percentage change from baseline. Where heterogeneity existed (determined by the I(2) statistic), we used a random-effects model. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-three RCTs (27 new in this update) with 4320 participants met the inclusion criteria. The most effective type of exercise intervention on bone mineral density (BMD) for the neck of femur appears to be non-weight bearing high force exercise such as progressive resistance strength training for the lower limbs (MD 1.03; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 1.82). The most effective intervention for BMD at the spine was combination exercise programmes (MD 3.22; 95\% CI 1.80 to 4.64) compared with control groups. Fractures and falls were reported as adverse events in some studies. There was no effect on numbers of fractures (odds ratio (OR) 0.61; 95\% CI 0.23 to 1.64). Overall, the quality of the reporting of studies in the meta-analyses was low, in particular in the areas of sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and loss to follow-up. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a relatively small statistically significant, but possibly important, effect of exercise on bone density compared with control groups. Exercise has the potential to be a safe and effective way to avert bone loss in postmenopausal women.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In older adults, diminished balance is associated with reduced physical functioning and an increased risk of falling. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2007. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of exercise interventions on balance in older people, aged 60 and over, living in the community or in institutional care. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE and EMBASE (to February 2011). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled studies testing the effects of exercise interventions on balance in older people. The primary outcomes of the review were clinical measures of balance. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Pairs of review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data from studies. Data were pooled where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: This update included 94 studies (62 new) with 9,917 participants. Most participants were women living in their own home.Most trials were judged at unclear risk of selection bias, generally reflecting inadequate reporting of the randomisation methods, but at high risk of performance bias relating to lack of participant blinding, which is largely unavoidable for these trials. Most studies only reported outcome up to the end of the exercise programme.There were eight categories of exercise programmes. These are listed below together with primary measures of balance for which there was some evidence of a statistically significant effect at the end of the exercise programme. Some trials tested more than one type of exercise. Crucially, the evidence for each outcome was generally from only a few of the trials for each exercise category. 1. Gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks (19 studies of which 10 provided primary outcome data): Timed Up \& Go test (mean difference (MD) -0.82 s; 95\% CI -1.56 to -0.08 s, 114 participants, 4 studies); walking speed (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.43; 95\% CI 0.11 to 0.75, 156 participants, 4 studies), and the Berg Balance Scale (MD 3.48 points; 95\% CI 2.01 to 4.95 points, 145 participants, 4 studies).2. Strengthening exercise (including resistance or power training) (21 studies of which 11 provided primary outcome data): Timed Up \& Go Test (MD -4.30 s; 95\% CI -7.60 to -1.00 s, 71 participants, 3 studies); standing on one leg for as long as possible with eyes closed (MD 1.64 s; 95\% CI 0.97 to 2.31 s, 120 participants, 3 studies); and walking speed (SMD 0.25; 95\% CI 0.05 to 0.46, 375 participants, 8 studies).3. 3D (3 dimensional) exercise (including Tai Chi, qi gong, dance, yoga) (15 studies of which seven provided primary outcome data): Timed Up \& Go Test (MD -1.30 s; 95\% CI -2.40 to -0.20 s, 44 participants, 1 study); standing on one leg for as long as possible with eyes open (MD 9.60 s; 95\% CI 6.64 to 12.56 s, 47 participants, 1 study), and with eyes closed (MD 2.21 s; 95\% CI 0.69 to 3.73 s, 48 participants, 1 study); and the Berg Balance Scale (MD 1.06 points; 95\% CI 0.37 to 1.76 points, 150 participants, 2 studies).4. General physical activity (walking) (seven studies of which five provided primary outcome data). 5. General physical activity (cycling) (one study which provided data for walking speed). 6. Computerised balance training using visual feedback (two studies, neither of which provided primary outcome data). 7. Vibration platform used as intervention (three studies of which one provided primary outcome data).8. Multiple exercise types (combinations of the above) (43 studies of which 29 provided data for one or more primary outcomes): Timed Up \& Go Test (MD -1.63 s; 95\% CI -2.28 to -0.98 s, 635 participants, 12 studies); standing on one leg for as long as possible with eyes open (MD 5.03 s; 95\% CI 1.19 to 8.87 s, 545 participants, 9 studies), and with eyes closed ((MD 1.60 s; 95\% CI -0.01 to 3.20 s, 176 participants, 2 studies); walking speed (SMD 0.04; 95\% CI -0.10 to 0.17, 818 participants, 15 studies); and the Berg Balance Scale ((MD 1.84 points; 95\% CI 0.71 to 2.97 points, 80 participants, 2 studies).Few adverse events were reported but most studies did not monitor or report adverse events.In general, the more effective programmes ran three times a week for three months and involved dynamic exercise in standing. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is weak evidence that some types of exercise (gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks; strengthening exercise; 3D exercise and multiple exercise types) are moderately effective, immediately post intervention, in improving clinical balance outcomes in older people. Such interventions are probably safe. There is either no or insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions for general physical activity (walking or cycling) and exercise involving computerised balance programmes or vibration plates. Further high methodological quality research using core outcome measures and adequate surveillance is required.},

  abstract = {All the current frailty measures count deficits. They differ chiefly in which items, and how many, they consider. These differences are related: if a measure considers only a few items, to define broad risks those items need to integrate across several systems (e.g. mobility or function). If many items are included, the cumulative effect of small deficits can be considered. Even so, it is not clear just how small deficits can be. To better understand how the scale of deficit accumulation might impact frailty measurement, we consider how age-related, subcellular deficits might become macroscopically visible and so give rise to frailty. Cellular deficits occur when subcellular damage has neither been repaired nor cleared. With greater cellular deficit accumulation, detection becomes more likely. Deficit detection can be done by either subclinical (e.g. laboratory, imaging, electrodiagnostic) or clinical methods. Not all clinically evident deficits need cross a disease threshold. The extent to which cellular deficit accumulation compromises organ function can reflect not just what is happening in that organ system, but deficit accumulation in other organ systems too. In general, frailty arises in relation to the number of organ systems in which deficits accumulate. This understanding of how subcellular deficits might scale has implications for understanding frailty as a vulnerability state. Considering the cumulative effects of many small deficits appears to allow important aspects of the behaviour of systems close to failure to be observed. It also suggests the potential to detect frailty with less reliance on clinical observation than current methods employ.},

Using inpatient data from an urban teaching hospital, we examined how elements of individual characteristics and neighborhood socioeconomic status influenced the likelihood of readmission under a single fixed organizational and staffing structure. Patients living in high-poverty neighborhoods were 24 percent more likely than others to be readmitted, after demographic characteristics and clinical conditions were adjusted for. Married patients were at significantly reduced risk of readmission, which suggests that they had more social support than unmarried patients. These and previous findings that document socioeconomic disparities in readmission raise the question of whether CMS's readmission measures and associated financial penalties should be adjusted for the effects of factors beyond hospital influence at the individual or neighborhood level, such as poverty and lack of social support.},

Methods: Structural equation model (SEM) was employed to assess the psychometric properties of the infectious disease-specific health literacy scale. Based on the database from a randomly selected sample of 4 499 adult residents in three provinces in China, from March to May 2015. AMOS 21.0 software was used to build the SEM for data analyses. Results: SEM analyses showed a good model fit of data, with the following satisfied parameters: goodness-of-fit index was 0.969, adjusted goodness-of-fit index was 0.962, root mean square residual was 0.038, root mean square error of approximation was 0.038, standardized root mean square residual was 0.032, Tacker-Lewis index/non-normed fit index was 0.926, comparative fit index was 0.934, normed fit index was 0.925, relative fit index was 0.915, incremental fit index was 0.934, parsimony goodness-of-fit index was 0.782, parsimony-adjusted normed fit index was 0.817, parsimony-adjusted comparative fit index was 0.825 and critical N was 702. The established SEM showed that the total influence path coefficient of "infectious disease-related knowledge and values" on the "infectious disease prevention" , "management or treatment of infectious diseases" and "identification of infection sources" were 0.771, 0.744 and 0.843, respectively. The total influence path coefficients of "identification of infection sources" , "infectious disease prevention" on "management or treatment of infectious diseases" were 0.164 and 0.535, respectively. The effect of "infectious disease-related knowledge and values" on "management or treatment of infectious diseases" appeared the greatest (55.4\%), followed by "infectious disease prevention" (28.6\%) and "identification of infection sources" (2.7\%). Conclusion: This SEM could be optimistically used for planning and evaluation of health education and promotion programs on infectious diseases prevention.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               To identify the range of glycemic levels associated with the lowest rates of complications and mortality in older diabetic patients.                                         RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS               We conducted a retrospective cohort study (2004--2008) of 71,092 patients with type 2 diabetes, aged {$\geq$}60 years, enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We specified Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the relationships between baseline glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and subsequent outcomes (nonfatal complications [acute metabolic, microvascular, and cardiovascular events] and mortality).                                         RESULTS               The cohort (aged 71.0 {\textpm} 7.4 years [means {\textpm} SD]) had a mean A1C of 7.0 {\textpm} 1.2\%. The risk of any nonfatal complication rose monotonically for levels of A1C \&gt;6.0\% (e.g., adjusted hazard ratio 1.09 [95\% CI 1.02--1.16] for A1C 6.0--6.9\% and 1.86 [1.63--2.13] for A1C {$\geq$}11.0\%). Mortality had a U-shaped relationship with A1C. Compared with the risk with A1C \&lt;6.0\%, mortality risk was lower for A1C levels between 6.0 and 9.0\% (e.g., 0.83 [0.76--0.90] for A1C 7.0--7.9\%) and higher at A1C {$\geq$}11.0\% (1.31 [1.09--1.57]). Risk of any end point (complication or death) became significantly higher at A1C {$\geq$}8.0\%. Patterns generally were consistent across age-groups (60--69, 70--79, and {$\geq$}80 years).                                         CONCLUSIONS               Observed relationships between A1C and combined end points support setting a target of A1C \&lt;8.0\% for older patients, with the caution that A1Cs \&lt;6.0\% were associated with increased mortality risk. Additional research is needed to evaluate the low A1C--mortality relationship, as well as protocols for individualizing diabetes care.},

The aim of our study is to investigate the relationships between health literacy and frailty among community-dwelling seniors. This cross-sectional study enrolled 603 community-dwelling older adults (307 women) in residential areas, with a mean age of 70.9 {\textpm} 5.82 years. Health literacy was assessed using the Mandarin version of the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire. Physical frailty was defined by Fried frailty phenotype. Logistic regression was carried out to determine potential risk factors of frailty. In the multivariate logistic regression model, physical activity (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.47, 95\% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.06{$^-$}2.03) and health literacy (sufficient vs. excellent: OR 2.51, 95\% CI 1.32{$^-$}4.77) were associated with prefrailty and frailty. In subgroup analysis, pre-frailty and frailty were also negatively associated with health literacy in individuals with 'insufficiently active' (inadequate vs. excellent: OR 5.44, 95\% CI 1.6{$^-$}18.45) and 'sufficiently/highly active' physical activity levels (sufficient vs. excellent: OR 2.41, 95\% CI 1.07{$^-$}5.42). Therefore, in these community-dwelling elderly adults, health literacy was associated with pre-frailty and frailty regardless of age, gender, socio-economic status, and education level.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) incurs tremendous health costs associated with various complications due to poor diabetes control. Medication adherence, which is correlated with patients' health literacy, should be consistently practiced achieving optimal diabetes control. A deeper understanding of the specific communication and psychosocial factors related to medication-taking behaviors across different levels of health literacy among people with T2D will guide the development of effective interventions and strategies to enhance medication adherence. OBJECTIVES: This cross-sectional study aimed to identify salient patient factors associated with diabetes medication adherence across different levels of health literacy. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered via a face-to-face approach with 205 participants at a family medicine clinic. Study participants were all above 20~years of age with T2D, were prescribed at least one oral diabetes medication, and understood English. The questionnaire assessed participants' health literacy, self-efficacy for medication use, beliefs in medicines, patient-provider communication, perceived barriers to medication adherence, and self-reported medication adherence. Separate analysis of covariance was used to compare the mean scores of patient factors related to medication adherence across people with different health literacy levels. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 61~years old, and the majority of the participants were female (57\%), White (75\%), and college educated (62\%). Thirty-three percent of the participants had adequate health literacy, but only 43\% of them reported high adherence to their diabetes medications. Analysis of covariance showed that having stronger self-efficacy (P~{$<~$}0.001), lower concern beliefs about medication (P~=~0.047), and fewer perceived barriers to medication-taking (P~{$<~$}0.001), are necessary for better medication adherence. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that practitioners should address concern beliefs among low-adherent patients with low health literacy, help improve self-efficacy, and address perceived barriers to medication adherence among all low-adherent patients to optimally support patients' diabetes care.},

Variables investigated included physical activity, community activity, tobacco usage, alcohol consumption, and betel-nut chewing. Degree of health literacy was evaluated using the Chinese-language version of the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire. Most respondents had inadequate (17.6\%), or problematic (49.3\%), general health literacy. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that low educational attainment was closely associated with inadequate or problematic general health literacy. Women who did not engage in regular physical activity or direct community activity were more likely to have inadequate and problematic general health literacy, respectively. Selected unhealthy behaviors (tobacco usage, alcohol consumption, betel-nut chewing) were not associated with health literacy. Low health literacy was prevalent among participants. Lower educational attainment and a lack of physical or community activity were associated with low health literacy. Health literacy should be considered during the process of delivering health information, and health education programs must enhance health literacy tailored to address individuals' lifestyles.},

  abstract = {Inflammation in patients defined as frail by Fried's phenotypic definition may be related to sarcopenia. This study aimed to investigate inflammation in older patients across different frailty criteria. Frailty status was determined in 110 patients aged over 75 years (mean 83.9 years) according to function (dependent, intermediate, independent); Fried (three or more items of exhaustion, weight loss, slow walking speed, low handgrip strength, low physical activity) and Frailty Index (a measure of accumulated deficits). With increasing patient frailty as defined by function and by Fried phenotype, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) increased significantly. Albumin was lowest in the frailest subjects by each definition. The greatest differences were seen between intermediate and dependent groups and between the pre-frail and frail. Adjustment for multiple covariates (age, sex, BMI category, smoking status, number of co-morbidities and number of prescribed medications) did not account for any of the observed differences in levels of inflammatory markers. The Frailty Index correlated significantly with log-transformed CRP (r= 0.221, P {$<$} 0.05), log-transformed IL-6 (r= 0.369, P {$<$} 0.01), TNF-alpha (r= 0.379, P {$<$} 0.01) and inversely with albumin (r=- 0.545, P {$<$} 0.01). This study provides further evidence linking inflammation and frailty in older people, an association that seems consistent across different frailty measures.},

However, obesity is associated with disability and with physiological markers also recently linked with frailty, for example, increased inflammation and low antioxidant capacity. We aimed to explore the relationship between frailty and body mass index (BMI) in older people.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: Data were from 3,055 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and older who participated in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Frailty was defined both by an index of accumulated deficits and by the Fried phenotype. BMI was divided into five categories, and waist circumference 88 cm or more (for women) and 102 cm or more (for men) was defined as high. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age, wealth, level of education, and smoking status.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: The association between BMI and frailty showed a U-shaped curve. This relationship was consistent across different frailty measures. The lowest frailty index (FI) scores and lowest prevalence of Fried frailty were in those with BMI 25-29.9. At each BMI category, and using either measure of frailty, those with a high waist circumference were significantly more frail.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Both the phenotypic definition of frailty and the FI show increased levels of frailty among those with low and very high BMIs. In view of the rise in obesity in older populations, the benefits and feasibility of diet and exercise for obese older adults should be a focus of urgent inquiries. The association of frailty with a high waist circumference, even among underweight older people, suggests that truncal obesity may be an additional target for intervention.},

  abstract = {AIMS: To compare the relative prognostic importance in older people of diagnosed diabetes, the number and severity of co-morbidities and frailty. METHODS: Two thousand three hundred and five people aged {$>$} or = 70 years comprised the clinical examination cohort of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging. Frailty was defined as a score of {$>$} or = 5 on a 7-point Clinical Frailty Scale. The cohort was followed for 5 years. RESULTS: Diabetes was more likely to be associated with medium-term mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.42; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-1.69) than co-morbidity (HR 1.03; 95\% CI 1.01-1.05). Frailty most strongly predicted death (HR 2.72; 95\% CI 2.34-3.16). Frail older adults were 2.62 times (95\% CI 1.36-5.06) more likely to have a complication of diabetes, independent of age, sex and number of years living with diabetes. People with diabetes were younger than those without (81.3 vs. 83.3 years) but a similar proportion were frail (42.2 vs.43.4\%). The median life expectancy for frail older adults with diabetes was 23 months (95\% CI 18-28 months). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, the risk of mortality in older people was defined more precisely by a clinical measure of frailty than by diabetes or burden of co-morbidity. Those with diagnosed diabetes were younger than those without but had the same frailty status; diabetes can therefore be considered to increase 'biological age' by 2 years in those aged over 70 years. The limited life expectancy of frail older people with diabetes highlights the importance of recognizing frailty and supports the individualization of care in older people with diabetes.},

The identification of risk factors and people most at risk is an important step in guiding prevention and intervention strategies. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between literacy and multimorbidity while controlling for potential confounders. METHODS: Participants were adult patients attending the family medicine clinic of a regional health centre in Saguenay (Quebec), Canada. Literacy was measured with the Newest Vital Sign (NVS). Multimorbidity was measured with the Disease Burden Morbidity Assessment (DBMA) by self-report. Information on potential confounders (age, sex, education and family income) was also collected. The association between literacy (independent variable) and multimorbidity was examined in bivariate and multivariate analyses. Two operational definitions of multimorbidity were used successively as the dependent variable; confounding variables were introduced into the model as potential predictors. RESULTS: One hundred three patients (36 men) 19-83 years old were recruited; 41.8\% had completed 12 years of school or less. Forty-seven percent of patients provided fewer than four correct answers on the NVS (possible low literacy) whereas 53\% had four correct responses or more. Literacy and multimorbidity were associated in bivariate analyses (p {$<$} 0.01) but not in multivariate analyses, including age and family income. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that there is no relationship between literacy and multimorbidity when controlling for age and family income.},

  abstract = {To evaluate the effects of demographic and perceptive factors on the knowledge, perception, and behavior regarding antibiotic use in the general public, we conducted three serial telephone interview surveys in 2010, 2012, and 2015. Computer-aided telephone interview was conducted, with a predetermined quota stratified by sex, age, and geographic location. Respondents who answered correctly to four or more questions were categorized as having better knowledge. A total of 3013 respondents participated. Better knowledge was associated with age {$<$}\,60~years (OR 1.37, 95\% CI 1.04--1.82), college education (OR 1.57, 95\% CI 1.26--1.97), healthcare-related occupation or education (OR 2.26, 95\% CI 1.52--3.36), and media exposure (OR 1.25, 95\% CI 1.02--1.54). In contrast, correct antibiotic use behavior was associated with male sex (OR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.27--1.73), older age (OR 1.63, 95\% CI 1.34--1.99), and being married (OR 1.26, 95\% CI 1.04--1.52), along with better knowledge (OR 1.43, 95\% CI 1.19--1.71). However, multifaceted analysis indicated that better knowledge was associated with correct behavior in all subgroups. Other demographic factors were associated only in respondents with poor knowledge. Various factors other than knowledge on antibiotics, many of them traditionally underappreciated, affect antibiotic use behavior.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Case management is a collaborative practice involving coordination of care by a range of health professionals, both within the community and at the interface of primary and secondary care. It has been promoted as a way of reducing unplanned admissions in older people. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to systematically review evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding the effectiveness of case management in reducing the risk of unplanned hospital admissions in older people. METHODS: Eighteen databases were searched from inception to June 2010. Relevant websites were searched with key words and reference lists of included studies checked. A risk-of-bias tool was used to assess included studies and data extraction performed using customized tables. The primary outcome of interest was enumeration of unplanned hospital admission or readmissions. RESULTS: Eleven trials of case management in the older population were included. Risk of bias was generally low. Six were trials of hospital-initiated case management. Three were suitable for meta-analysis, of which two showed a reduction in unplanned admissions. Overall, there was no statistically significant reduction in unplanned admissions [relative rate: 0.71 (95\% confidence interval, CI: 0.49 to 1.03)]. Three trials reported reduced length of stay. Five trials were of community-initiated case management. None showed a reduction in unplanned admissions. Three were suitable for meta-analysis [mean difference in unplanned admissions: 0.05 (95\% CI: -0.04 to 0.15)]. CONCLUSIONS: The identified trials included a range of case management interventions. Nine of the 11 trials showed no reduction of unplanned hospital admissions with case management compared with the same with usual care.},

  abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is now a global threat. Its emergence rests on antimicrobial overuse in humans and food-producing animals; globalization and suboptimal infection control facilitate its spread. While aggressive measures in some countries have led to the containment of some resistant gram-positive organisms, extensively resistant gram-negative organisms such as carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae and pan-resistant Acinetobacter spp. continue their rapid spread. Antimicrobial conservation/stewardship programs have seen some measure of success in reducing antimicrobial overuse in humans, but their reach is limited to acute-care settings in high-income countries. Outside the European Union, there is scant or no oversight of antimicrobial administration to food-producing animals, while evidence mounts that this administration leads directly to resistant human infections. Both horizontal and vertical infection control measures can interrupt transmission among humans, but many of these are costly and essentially limited to high-income countries as well. Novel antimicrobials are urgently needed; in recent decades pharmaceutical companies have largely abandoned antimicrobial discovery and development given their high costs and low yield. Against this backdrop, international and cross-disciplinary collaboration appears to be taking root in earnest, although specific strategies still need defining. Educational programs targeting both antimicrobial prescribers and consumers must be further developed and supported. The general public must continue to be made aware of the current scale of AMR's threat, and must perceive antimicrobials as they are: a non-renewable and endangered resource.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rural Nigeria has one of the greatest burdens of low back pain but there are no effective evidence-based interventions to manage it in this population. This paper presents the application of the intervention mapping (IM) approach in the development of a complex behavior change intervention - The Good Back program, aimed at reducing non-specific chronic low back pain (CLBP) disability in rural Nigeria. METHODS: The first four steps of IM were applied. A critical review of the literature, 2 qualitative studies and a population-based cross-sectional study in rural Nigeria helped to identify two key program objectives in order to reduce CLBP disability in this population: reduce the impact of illness perceptions, fear avoidance beliefs, catastrophising, anxiety and depression by targeting maladaptive illness perceptions about CLBP; and facilitate the adoption of exercises and good posture to limit disability. A systematic review plus these studies, identified the personal and environmental determinants of the performance objectives including health literacy, self-awareness, self-efficacy, personal preference, health professional skills, health facility structure and family/community support. The theory, techniques and strategies for modifying personal and environmental determinants were also identified from these studies. Intervention components and materials were then produced for practical application. The initial developed intervention was described. RESULTS: The feasibility and acceptability of the developed program was then tested using a small pragmatic non-randomised controlled study incorporating qualitative exit feedback interviews in a rural Nigerian primary health care centre. The program appeared feasible and acceptable when delivered by a highly trained physiotherapist. There were promising clinical outcomes in disability, pain intensity, illness perceptions, fear avoidance beliefs and pain medication use. Suggestions for program improvement included shorter but ongoing sessions, video demonstration of exercises/good posture, spacious exercise/demonstration rooms, and community legitimisation of exercise as treatment for back pain. Subsequent modifications to program content and delivery were then described. Theoretical modification included the addition of aspects of the social cognitive theory to the Leventhal's self-regulatory model of illness cognitions. CONCLUSIONS: IM appears to be a suitable framework for designing complex behavior change interventions in rural Nigeria. The need for further testing of the intervention was highlighted.},

Our society wishes to ensure quality health care for all older people, but there is growing concern about our ability to maintain and improve quality in the face of efforts to contain health care costs. Medicare: A Strategy for Quality Assurance answers the U.S. Congress' call for the Institute of Medicine to design a strategic plan for assessing and assuring the quality of medical care for the elderly. This book presents a proposed strategic plan for improving quality assurance in the Medicare program, along with steps and timetables for implementing the plan by the year 2000 and the 10 recommendations for action by Congress. The book explores quality of care--how it is defined, measured, and improved--and reviews different types of quality problems. Major issues that affect approaches to assessing and assuring quality are examined. Medicare: A Strategy for Quality Assurance will be immediately useful to a wide audience, including policymakers, health administrators, individual providers, specialists in issues of the older American, researchers, educators, and students.},

The committee reviewed the extant published and unpublished epidemiological studies regarding causality and studies of potential biologic mechanisms by which these immunizations might cause autism. The committee concludes that the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. The committee also concludes that the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. The committee further finds that potential biological mechanisms for vaccine-induced autism that have been generated to date are theoretical only. The committee does not recommend a policy review of the current schedule and recommendations for the administration of either the MMR vaccine or thimerosal-containing vaccines. The committee recommends a public health response that fully supports an array of vaccine safety activities. In addition, the committee recommends that available funding for autism research be channeled to the most promising areas. The committee makes additional recommendations regarding surveillance and epidemiological research, clinical studies, and communication related to these vaccine safety concerns.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to develop a causal model of family well-being with health literacy (HL) as a mediator and to compare models between male and female spouses in urban and rural communities. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: The samples included 2000 spouses at risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by stratified randomly sampled in 2018. Data were collected Likert questionnaires with reliability of 0.79-0.93, and analyzed via confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and multi-group structural equation modeling (MSEM). RESULTS: A causal model for the overall group was consistent with the data. Causal factors had direct effects on health behavior including social norms, positive attitude toward health, psychological capital, and HL ({$\beta$}=0.11, 0.14, 0.30, and 0.41, P{$<$}0.05 respectively). Health behavior and positive attitudes towards health had direct effects on family well-being ({$\beta$}=0.36 and 0.42, P{$<$}0.05, respectively). All factors could predict health behavior and family well-being with variance of 70\% and 50\%. Invariance analysis of models showed no difference between male and female spouses. In addition, the mean comparison of latent variables showed that the positive attitudes towards health were lower in women than men. HL and positive attitudes towards health of spouses in urban were lower than in rural communities. CONCLUSION: Thai adult families in cities were at higher risk with NCDs. Therefore, health providers need to address HL and positive attitude toward health which were the main causal factors.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize seniors' beliefs about generic drugs, and examine potential correlates of these beliefs, including socioeconomic and health status variables, health literacy, and physician communication skills. METHODS: Older adults ({$>$} or = 65 years) were interviewed in two primary care practices of an inner-city, tertiary care hospital (n = 311). Beliefs about generics were measured using a scale that compared generic and brand name drugs across four domains. Beliefs were modeled with multivariable linear regression. RESULTS: Negative beliefs about generics were associated with non-white race (p {$<$} 0.0001), lower education (p = 0.008) and income (p = 0.001), and having Medicaid coverage (p = 0.001). Individuals with low health literacy and who reported that their physicians had poor communication skills were more likely to hold negative views (p {$<$} 0.0001 and p = 0.003, respectively). In multivariable analysis, black race (beta = -2.30, p = 0.006) and inadequate health literacy (beta = -2.17, p = 0.0004) remained strongly associated with negative views about generic drugs. Poor physician communication skills also predicted negative beliefs about generics but the association was not significant for all levels of communication skill. CONCLUSION: Many low-income seniors mistrust generic medications, especially African-Americans and seniors with low health literacy. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Educational efforts to promote generic medications should account for patients' health literacy and cultural backgrounds.},

The purpose of this study was to examine HCAIs occurring in elderly inpatients in our hospital.Materials and methods: This study prospectively investigated HCAIs developing in all patients hospitalized over a 1-year period. Diagnosis was based on Centers for Disease Control criteria. The results were subjected to statistical analysis between patients aged over and under 65.Results: A total of 24,692 patients were evaluated and 894 HCAIs were identified. Of these infections, 214 were seen in patients aged 65 or over. The rate of HCAIs in elderly patients was 15.1, compared to 2.9 in the under-65 patient group (P {$<$} 0.001). Seventy-nine (36.9\%) infections in elderly patients were urinary system infections, 60 (28.0\%) were bacteremia, 43 (20.1\%) were pneumonia, 29 (13.6\%) were surgical site infections, and 3 (1.4\%) were other infections. Forty-three of the 187 elderly patients followed with a diagnosis of HCAI died. Seventeen patients had mortality attributable to HCAI. Conclusion: Awareness that HCAIs seen in the elderly have different clinical and microbiological characteristics than those of other patients, and the appropriate precautions being taken, will reduce the problems that may result from these diseases with high mortality and morbidity.},

RESULTS: Significant risk factors identified were male gender, numerous diagnoses, length of stay 3 days or longer and patients being admitted from acute, subacute or aged-care facilities. CONCLUSIONS: The high risk of patients being readmitted from acute, subacute and aged-care services requires further review as these readmissions may be avoidable. It may also be useful to develop a readmission risk screening tool so that patients at risk of readmission can be identified. What is known about this topic? Older adults with CHF are likely to experience multiple readmissions to hospital. There have been several studies conducted on hospital readmissions; however, generalising the findings is problematic due to the use of variable definitions of what constitutes a readmission. What does this paper add? This paper addresses the absence of Australian research comparing groups of older patients with CHF who are readmitted to hospital with those who are not readmitted. It also adopts one of the more frequently used definitions of readmission to aid in future comparability of research. What are the implications for practice? Further work is necessary to improve discharge planning and effectively manage chronic illnesses such as CHF in patients' homes. It may be useful to develop a readmission risk screening tool for staff of inpatient medical wards so that these at-risk patients can be identified before discharge.},

Little is known about the concordance of these methods. METHODS: We manually reviewed 459 30-day, all-cause readmissions at 18 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals, determining potential preventability through a four-step manual review process that included a chart review tool, interviews with patients, their families, and treating providers, and nurse reviewer and physician evaluation of findings and determination of preventability on a five-point scale. We reassessed the same readmissions with 3 M's Potentially Preventable Readmission (PPR) software. We examined between-method agreement and the specificity and sensitivity of the PPR software using manual review as the reference. RESULTS: Automated classification and manual review respectively identified 78\% (358) and 47\% (227) of readmissions as potentially preventable. Overall, the methods agreed about the preventability of 56\% (258) of readmissions. Using manual review as the reference, the sensitivity of PPR was 85\% and specificity was 28\%. CONCLUSIONS: Concordance between methods was not high enough to replace manual review with automated classification as the primary method of identifying preventable 30-day, all-cause readmission for quality improvement purposes.},

  abstract = {Couples are highly concordant for unhealthy behaviors, and a change in one partner's health behavior is often associated with a change in the other partner's behavior. However, no studies have explicitly compared the influence of having a partner who takes up healthy behavior (eg, quits smoking) with one whose behavior is consistently healthy (eg, never smokes).To examine the influence of partner's behavior on making positive health behavior changes.We used prospective data from married and cohabiting couples (n, 3722) participating in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a large population-based cohort of older adults ({$\geq$}50 years). Studying men and women who had unhealthy behaviors in 3 domains at baseline (ie, smoking, physically inactive, or overweight/obese), we used logistic regression analysis to examine the influence of the partner's behavior in the same domain on the odds of positive health behavior change over time.Smoking cessation, increased physical activity, and 5\% weight loss or greater.Across all domains, we found that when one partner changed to a healthier behavior (newly healthy), the other partner was more likely to make a positive health behavior change than if their partner remained unhealthy (smoking: men 48\% vs 8\%, adjusted odds ratio [OR], 11.82 [95\% CI, 4.84-28.90]; women 50\% vs 8\%, OR, 11.23 [4.58-27.52]) (physical activity: men 67\% vs 26\%, OR, 5.28 [3.70-7.54]; women 66\% vs 24\%, OR, 5.36 [3.74-7.68]) (weight loss: men 26\% vs 10\%, OR, 3.05 [1.96-4.74]; women 36\% vs 15\%, OR, 3.08 [1.98-4.80]). For smoking and physical activity, having a consistently healthy partner also predicted positive change, but for each domain, the odds were significantly higher in individuals with a newly healthy partner than those with a consistently healthy partner (smoking: men OR, 3.08 [1.43-6.62]; women OR, 5.45 [2.44-12.16]) (physical activity: men OR, 1.92 [1.37-2.70]; women OR, 1.84 [1.33-2.53]) (weight loss: men OR, 2.28 [1.36-3.84]; women OR, 2.86 [1.55-5.26]).Men and women are more likely to make a positive health behavior change if their partner does too, and with a stronger effect than if the partner had been consistently healthy in that domain. Involving partners in behavior change interventions may therefore help improve outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In Sweden, day surgery is performed in almost 2 million patients per year. Patient satisfaction is closely related to potential adverse events during the recovery process. A way to empower patients and give them the opportunity to affect care delivery is to let them evaluate their recovery process. The most common evaluation method is a follow-up telephone call by a nurse one or two days after surgery. In recent years, mHealth apps have been used to evaluate the nurse-patient relationship for self-management in chronic diseases or to evaluate pain after surgery. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research has explored the recovery process after day surgery via mobile phone in a Swedish cohort. OBJECTIVE The objective of the study is to describe the process of developing a mobile phone app using a Swedish Web-based Quality of Recovery (SwQoR) questionnaire to evaluate postoperative recovery after day surgery. METHODS The development process included five steps: (1) setting up an interdisciplinary task force, (2) evaluating the potential needs of app users, (3) developing the Swedish Web version of a QoR questionnaire, (4) constructing a mobile phone app, and (5) evaluating the interface and design by staff working in a day-surgery department and patients undergoing day surgery. A task force including specialists in information and communication technology, eHealth, and nursing care worked closely together to develop a Web-based app. Modifications to the QoR questionnaire were inspired by instruments used in the field of recovery for both children and adults. The Web-based app, Recovery Assessment by Phone Points (RAPP) consists of two parts: (1) a mobile app installed on the patient's private mobile phone, and (2) an administrator interface for the researchers. RESULTS The final version of the SwQoR questionnaire, which includes 31 items, was successfully installed in RAPP. The interface and the design were evaluated by asking for user opinions about the design and usefulness of the app with 10 day surgery patients. Some minor adjustments were made concerning text size and screen color. CONCLUSIONS Taking advantage of joint expertise, a useable Web-based app adaptable to different technical platforms was constructed. In addition, the SwQoR was successfully transferred into digital format for use on mobile phones.},

The accompanying and supporting patients during the disease treatment is very effective in the Iranian culture. AIM: This study aims at determining the effect of health intervention based on family-centred empowerment model on health literacy and self-efficacy among caregivers of patients with multiple sclerosis. METHODS: In this quasi-experimental study, 70 family caregivers were randomly assigned to the two control and experimental groups, who were evaluated using demographic TOFHLA health literacy and self-efficacy questionnaires. Then, based on training needs in the experimental group, intervention was conducted based on the family-centred empowerment model during one month. The control group received no intervention, and immediately after training and three months after implementing the program, the health literacy and self-efficacy in both the experimental and control groups were re-evaluated. RESULTS: Before intervention, mean of health literacy in the experimental group was 57.2~{\textpm}~9.15 and 3~months after intervention, it reached 62.45~{\textpm}~9.39, (p~{$<~$}0.001). The self-efficacy score in the experimental group was 17.2~{\textpm}~3.48 before intervention and it reached to 19.34~{\textpm}~11.3 after intervention, which was also significant(p~{$<~$}0.001). CONCLUSION: interventions based on family-centred empowerment approach can improve the health literacy and self-efficacy of caregivers, assist them to provide specialised and efficient care and lead to improved quality of care in caregiving.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal deaths in developing countries. The current recommended in-hospital treatment is parenteral ampicillin  (or penicillin) and gentamicin in young infants for 10- 14 days; however, very  few could access and afford. The current review is to evaluate the feasibility of  gentamicin in community based settings. METHODS: Both observational and  randomized controlled trials were included. Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central  Register of Controlled Trials and Central Trial Register of India were searched  until September 2013. We assessed the risk of bias by Cochrane Collaboration's  "risk of bias" tool. RESULTS: Two observational studies indicated feasibility  ensuring coverage of population, decrease in case fatality rate in the group  treated by community health workers. In an RCT, no significant difference was  observed in the treatment failure rates [odds ratio (OR)=0.88], and the mortality  in the first and second week (OR=1.53; OR=2.24) between gentamicin and  ceftriaxone groups. Within the gentamicin group, the combination of penicillin  and gentamicin showed a lower rate of treatment failure (OR=0.44) and mortality  at second week of life (OR=0.17) as compared to the combination of gentamicin and  oral cotrimoxazole. CONCLUSION: Gentamicin for the treatment of neonatal sepsis  is both feasible and effective in community-based settings and can be used as an  alternative to the hospitalbased care in resource compromised settings. But there  was less evidence in the management of neonatal sepsis in hospitals as was seen  in this review in which we included only one RCT and three observational studies.},

METHOD Using a narrative synthesis approach, we reviewed published journal articles reporting qualitative data. Electronic and manual literature searches were conducted to identify 19 publications that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 16 discussed exercise and three focused on broader fall prevention programs. However, no studies were identified that explored the perspective of the program providers. RESULTS An overarching theme emerged identifying the influence of cultural values and perceptions on program participation. Also, identified were motivational, social and environmental influences. CONCLUSION Exercise and fall prevention interventions need to be culturally appropriate and utilise the positive influences of social support, especially from physicians and family. While these findings can be used to inform the delivery of programs to these population groups, future studies should focus specifically on experiences and perceptions of older CALD people of fall prevention programs as well as the perspectives of program providers. Implications for Rehabilitation Program participation is influenced by cultural values and motivational, social and environmental factors. The meaning and importance of exercise can vary between and within cultures. Exercise and fall prevention interventions need to be culturally appropriate and utilise the positive influences of social support, especially from physicians and family. Providing information that falls can be prevented and the reasons why behaviours need to change will be more likely to encourage older people from CALD backgrounds to contemplate participation.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low socioeconomic status (SES) is persistently associated with poor health and suboptimal use of healthcare services, and more unplanned healthcare use. Suboptimal use of emergency and acute healthcare services may increase health inequalities, due to late diagnosis or lack of continuity of care. Given that health literacy has been associated with healthcare utilisation and with education attainment, we sought to explore whether health literacy is related to the use of out-of-hours (OOH) Primary Care Services (PCSs). Additionally, we aimed to study whether and to what extent health literacy accounts for some of the association between education and OOH PSC use. METHODS: A survey including measures of education attainment, health literacy (assessed by means of the Dutch version of the nine-dimension Health Literacy Questionnaire) and use of PCS was conducted among a sample of adults diagnosed with (any) somatic chronic condition in the Netherlands (response 76.3\%, n\,=\,1811). We conducted linear and logistic regression analyses to examine associations between education level and PCS use in the past year. We performed mediation analyses to assess whether the association between education and PCS use was (partly) explained by different aspects of health literacy. We adjusted the models for patient characteristics such as age and morbidity. RESULTS: Higher education attainment was associated with higher scores on the health literacy aspects Appraisal of health information, and Navigating the healthcare system. Additionally, appraisal and navigating the healthcare system partially accounted for educational differences in PCS use. Finally, higher appraisal of health information scores were associated with higher PCS utilisation. CONCLUSION: Several aspects of health literacy were demonstrated to relate to PCS use, and partly accounted for educational differences herein. Accordingly, developing health literacy within individuals or communities may help to reduce inappropriate PCS use among people with low education.},

Whole body SM mass, determined by magnetic resonance imaging, was compared with BIA measurements in a multiethnic sample of 388 men and women, aged 18-86 yr, at two different laboratories. Within each laboratory, equations for predicting SM mass from BIA measurements were derived using the data of the Caucasian subjects. These equations were then applied to the Caucasian subjects from the other laboratory to cross-validate the BIA method. Because the equations cross-validated (i.e., were not different), the data from both laboratories were pooled to generate the final regression equation SM mass (kg) = [(Ht\textsuperscript{2}/ {$<$}IT{$>$}R{$<$}/IT{$>$} x 0.401) + (gender x 3.825) + (age x -0. 071)] + 5.102 where Ht is height in centimeters; R is BIA resistance in ohms; for gender, men = 1 and women = 0; and age is in years. The r(2) and SE of estimate of the regression equation were 0.86 and 2.7 kg (9\%), respectively. The Caucasian-derived equation was applicable to Hispanics and African-Americans, but it underestimated SM mass in Asians. These results suggest that the BIA equation provides valid estimates of SM mass in healthy adults varying in age and adiposity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reducing rates of rehospitalization has attracted attention from policymakers as a way to improve quality of care and reduce costs. However, we have limited information on the frequency and patterns of rehospitalization in the United States to aid in planning the necessary changes. METHODS: We analyzed Medicare claims data from 2003-2004 to describe the patterns of rehospitalization and the relation of rehospitalization to demographic characteristics of the patients and to characteristics of the hospitals. RESULTS: Almost one fifth (19.6\%) of the 11,855,702 Medicare beneficiaries who had been discharged from a hospital were rehospitalized within 30 days, and 34.0\% were rehospitalized within 90 days; 67.1\% [corrected] of patients who had been discharged with medical conditions and 51.5\% of those who had been discharged after surgical procedures were rehospitalized or died within the first year after discharge. In the case of 50.2\% [corrected] of the patients who were rehospitalized within 30 days after a medical discharge to the community, there was no bill for a visit to a physician's office between the time of discharge and rehospitalization. Among patients who were rehospitalized within 30 days after a surgical discharge, 70.5\% were rehospitalized for a medical condition. We estimate that about 10\% of rehospitalizations were likely to have been planned. The average stay of rehospitalized patients was 0.6 day longer than that of patients in the same diagnosis-related group whose most recent hospitalization had been at least 6 months previously. We estimate that the cost to Medicare of unplanned rehospitalizations in 2004 was \$17.4 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Rehospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries are prevalent and costly.},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a multifactorial intervention program would reduce falls and fall-related injuries. DESIGN: A cluster randomized, controlled, nonblinded trial. SETTING: 9 residential care facilities located in a northern Swedish city. PATIENTS: 439 residents 65 years of age or older. INTERVENTION: An 11-week multidisciplinary program that included both general and resident-specific, tailored strategies. The strategies comprised educating staff, modifying the environment, implementing exercise programs, supplying and repairing aids, reviewing drug regimens, providing free hip protectors, having post-fall problem-solving conferences, and guiding staff. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcomes were the number of residents sustaining a fall, the number of falls, and the time to occurrence of the first fall. A secondary outcome was the number of injuries resulting from falls. RESULTS: During the 34-week follow-up period, 82 residents (44\%) in the intervention program sustained a fall compared with 109 residents (56\%) in the control group (risk ratio, 0.78 [95\% CI, 0.64 to 0.96]). The adjusted odds ratio was 0.49 (CI, 0.37 to 0.65), and the adjusted incidence rate ratio of falls was 0.60 (CI, 0.50 to 0.73). Each of 3 residents in the intervention group and 12 in the control group had 1 femoral fracture (adjusted odds ratio, 0.23 [CI, 0.06 to 0.94]). Clustering was considered in all regression models. CONCLUSION: An interdisciplinary and multifactorial prevention program targeting residents, staff, and the environment may reduce falls and femoral fractures.},

DESIGN: A preplanned subgroup comparison of the effectiveness of a cluster-randomized, nonblinded, usual-care, controlled trial. SETTING: Nine residential facilities in Ume{\aa}, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: All consenting residents living in the facilities, aged 65 and older, who could be assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; n = 378). An MMSE score of 19 was used to divide the sample into one group with lower and one with higher level of cognition. The lower MMSE group was older (mean +/- standard deviation = 83.9 +/- 5.8 vs 82.2 +/- 7.5) and more functionally impaired (Barthel Index, median (interquartile range) 11 (6-15) vs 17 (13-18)) and had a higher risk of falling (64\% vs 36\%) than the higher MMSE group. INTERVENTION: A multifactorial fall prevention program comprising staff education, environmental adjustment, exercise, drug review, aids, hip protectors, and postfall problem-solving conferences. MEASUREMENTS: The number of falls, time to first fall, and number of injuries were evaluated and compared by study group (intervention vs control) and by MMSE group. RESULTS: A significant intervention effect on falls appeared in the higher MMSE group but not in the lower MMSE group (adjusted incidence rates ratio of falls P =.016 and P =.121 and adjusted hazard ratio P {$<$}.001 and P =.420, respectively). In the lower MMSE group, 10 femoral fractures were found, all of which occurred in the control group (P =.006). CONCLUSION: The higher MMSE group experienced fewer falls after this multifactorial intervention program, whereas the lower MMSE group did not respond as well to the intervention, but femoral fractures were reduced in the lower MMSE group.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Impaired mobility is one of the strongest predictors for falls in older people. We hypothesized that exercise as part of a fall prevention program would have positive effects, both short- and long-term, on gait, balance and strength in older people at high risk of falling and with varying levels of cognition, residing in residential care facilities. A secondary hypothesis was that these effects would be associated with a reduced risk of falling. METHODS: 187 out of all residents living in 9 facilities, {$>$} or =65 years of age were at high risk of falling. The facilities were cluster-randomized to fall intervention or usual care. The intervention program comprised: education, environment, individually designed exercise, drug review, post-fall assessments, aids, and hip protectors. Data were adjusted for baseline performance and clustering. RESULTS: At 11 weeks, positive intervention effects were found on independent ambulation (FAC, p=0.026), maximum gait speed (p=0.002), and step height ({$>$} or =10 cm, p{$<$}0.001), but not significantly on the Berg Balance Scale. At 9 months (long-term outcome), 3 intervention and 15 control residents had lost the ability to walk (p=0.001). Independent ambulation and maximum gait speed were maintained in the intervention group but deteriorated in the control group (p=0.001). Residents with both higher and lower cognition benefited in most outcome measures. No association was found between improved mobility and reduced risk of falling. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise, as part of a fall prevention program, appears to preserve the ability to walk, maintain gait speed, ambulate independently, and improve step height. Benefits were found in residents with both lower and higher cognitive impairment, but were not found to be associated with a reduced risk of falling.},

  abstract = {DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine the role played by length of hospital stay in the risk of healthcare-associated bloodstream infection (BSI), independent of demographic and clinical risk factors for BSI. PATIENTS: We employed data from 113,893 admissions from inpatients discharged between 2006 and 2008. SETTING: Large tertiary healthcare center in New York City. METHODS: We estimated the crude and adjusted hazard of BSI by conducting logistic regression using a person-day data structure. The covariates included in the fully adjusted model included age, sex, Charlson score of comorbidity, renal failure, and malignancy as static variables and central venous catheterization, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit stay as time-varying variables. RESULTS: In the crude model, we observed a nonlinear increasing hazard of BSI with increasing hospital stay. This trend was reduced to a constant hazard when fully adjusted for demographic and clinical risk factors for BSI. CONCLUSION: The association between longer length of hospital stay and increased risk of infection can largely be explained by the increased duration of stay among those who have underlying morbidity and require invasive procedures. We should take caution in attributing the association between length of stay and BSI to a direct negative impact of the healthcare environment.},

  abstract = {Background:A reduction in hospital readmissions may improve quality and reduce costs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has initiated a national effort to mea\- sure and publicly report on the conduct of discharge planning. We know little about how U.S. hospitals perform on the current discharge metrics, the factors that un\- derlie better performance, and whether better performance is related to lower re\- admission rates. Methods: We examined hospital performance on the basis of two measures of discharge plan\- ning: the adequacy of documentation in the chart that discharge instructions were provided to patients with congestive heart failure, and patient\-reported experiences with discharge planning. We examined the association between performance on these measures and rates of readmission for congestive heart failure and pneumonia. Results: We found a weak correlation in performance between the two discharge measures (r = 0.05, P{$<$}0.001). Although larger hospitals performed better on the chart \-based measure, smaller hospitals and those with higher nurse\-staffing levels performed better on the patient\-reported measure. We found no association between performance on the chart\-based measure and readmission rates among patients with congestive heart failure (readmission rates among hospitals performing in the highest quartile vs. the lowest quartile, 23.7\% vs. 23.5\%; P = 0.54) and only a very modest association between performance on the patient\-reported measure and readmission rates for congestive heart failure (readmission rates among hospitals performing in the high\- est qu a r t i le vs. t he lowest qu a r t i le, 22.4\% vs. 24.7\%; P{$<$}0.0 01) a nd pneu mon i a (17.5\% vs. 19.5\%, P{$<$}0.001). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that current efforts to collect and publicly report data on dis\- charge planning are unlikely to yield large reductions in unnecessary readmissions.},

Six healthy lifestyle factors were assessed: a healthy diet (adherence to the recommended intake of at least 7 of 12 eligible food items), regular physical exercise ({$\geq$}150 min of moderate intensity or {$\geq$}75 min of vigorous intensity, per week), active social contact ({$\geq$}twice per week), active cognitive activity ({$\geq$}twice per week), never or previously smoked, and never drinking alcohol. Participants were categorised into the favourable group if they had four to six healthy lifestyle factors, into the average group for two to three factors, and into the unfavourable group for zero to one factor. Memory function was assessed using the World Health Organization/University of California-Los Angeles Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and global cognition was assessed via the Mini-Mental State Examination. Linear mixed models were used to explore the impact of lifestyle factors on memory in the study sample.Results 29\,072 participants were included (mean age of 72.23 years; 48.54\% (n=14\,113) were women; and 20.43\% (n=5939) were APOE {$\varepsilon$}4 carriers). Over the 10 year follow-up period (2009-19), participants in the favourable group had slower memory decline than those in the unfavourable group (by 0.028 points/year, 95\% confidence interval 0.023 to 0.032, P{$<$}0.001). APOE {$\varepsilon$}4 carriers with favourable (0.027, 95\% confidence interval 0.023 to 0.031) and average (0.014, 0.010 to 0.019) lifestyles exhibited a slower memory decline than those with unfavourable lifestyles. Among people who were not carriers of APOE {$\varepsilon$}4, similar results were observed among participants in the favourable (0.029 points/year, 95\% confidence interval 0.019 to 0.039) and average (0.019, 0.011 to 0.027) groups compared with those in the unfavourable group. APOE {$\varepsilon$}4 status and lifestyle profiles did not show a significant interaction effect on memory decline (P=0.52).Conclusion A healthy lifestyle is associated with slower memory decline, even in the presence of the APOE {$\varepsilon$}4 allele. This study might offer important information to protect older adults against memory decline.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03653156.No additional data available.},

We examined the relationship between race/ethnicity and hospital readmissions for diabetes-related conditions. METHODS: Nonmaternal adult patients with Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance coverage hospitalized for diabetes-related conditions in 5 states were identified from the 1999 State Inpatient Databases of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Racial/ethnic differences in the likelihood of readmission were estimated by logistic regression with adjustment for patient demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic characteristics and hospital attributes. RESULTS: The risk-adjusted likelihood of 180-day readmission was significantly lower for non-Hispanic Whites than for Hispanics across all 3 payers or for non-Hispanic Blacks among Medicare enrollees. Within each payer, Hispanics from low-income communities had the highest risk of readmission. Among Medicare beneficiaries, Blacks and Hispanics had higher percentages of readmission for acute complications and microvascular disease, while Whites had higher percentages of readmission for macrovascular conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic disparities are more evident in 180-day than in 30-day readmission rates, and greatest among the Medicare population. Readmission diagnoses vary by race/ethnicity, with Blacks and Hispanics at higher risk for those complications more likely preventable with effective postdischarge care.},

This study was undertaken to understand the complexity of Medicaid readmission issues at the patient, provider, and system levels. METHODS: Multiple qualitative methods, including site visits to nine safety-net hospitals, patient/family/caregiver inter views, and semistructured interviews with health plans and state Medicaid agencies, were used in 2012 and 2013 to obtain information on patient, provider, and system issues related to Medicaid readmissions; strategies considered or currently used to address those issues; and any perceived financial, regulatory or, other policy factors inhibiting or facilitating readmission reduction efforts. RESULTS: Significant risk factors for Medicaid readmissions included financial stress, high prevalence of mental health and substance abuse disorders, medication nonadherence, and housing instability. Lacking awareness on Medicaid patients' high risk, a sufficient business case, and proven strategies for reducing readmissions were primary barriers for providers. Major hurdles at the system level included shortage of primary care and mental health providers, lack of coordination among providers, lack of partnerships between health plans and providers, and limited data capacity for realtime monitoring of readmissions. CONCLUSIONS: The intertwining of behavioral, socioeconomic, and health factors; the difficulty of accessing appropriate care in the outpatient setting; the lack of clear financial incentives for health care providers to reduce readmissions; and the fragmentation of the current health care system warrant greater attention and more concerted efforts from all stakeholders to reduce Medicaid readmissions.},

Caregiver health literacy (n~=~91) was assessed by the Newest Vital Sign. Limited health literacy presented in 38.5\% caregivers, with significantly low document literacy. Health literacy was associated bivariately with age, education, global cognitive function, executive function, and working memory (all ps~{$<~$}0.001), as well as medication knowledge (p~=~0.015). Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that older age (p~=~0.017), and lower global cognitive function (p~{$<~$}0.001), working memory (p~=~0.001), and academic skills (years of education) (p~=~0.004), independently predicted lower health literacy (R(2)~=~0.54). Medication knowledge, however, was not found to be an independent predictor in the model. Findings suggest limited health literacy is a potential issue among informal caregivers of adults with memory loss. Appropriate assessment and personalized support are needed for informal caregivers who are at high risk for poor health literacy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although neonatal sepsis is a major public health problem contributing to 30-50\% of neonatal deaths in low- and middle-income countries,  data on predictors of time to death are limited in Eastern Ethiopia. This study  is aimed at determining predictors of time to death among neonates with sepsis  admitted in public hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: An institutional-based  retrospective cohort study was conducted among 415 neonates admitted to referral  hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia with sepsis from January 1, 2021, to December 31,  2021. Data were collected from medical records by using structured checklist and  entered using EpiData 3.1 and analyzed using Stata 17. The Kaplan-Meier curves  and log-rank tests were used to describe survival experience among different  categories. The proportional hazard assumption and goodness of fit for the Cox  regression model were checked. The Cox regression model was used to identify the  significant predictors. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI)  were calculated. Finally, statistical significance was set at a p value {$<$} 0.05 in  the Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Of the 415 neonates with neonatal sepsis,  71 (17.1\%) (95\% CI: 13.60-21.08) died at discharge, with a median time to death  of 14 days. The overall incidence rate of mortality was 36.5 per 1000 neonate  days. Low birthweight (AHR = 2.50; 95\% CI: 1.15-5.44), maternal age {$\geq$} 35 years  (AHR = 3.17; 95\% CI: 1.11, 9.04), low fifth-minute Apgar score (AHR: 2.32; 95\%  CI: 1.30-4.14), and late initiation of breastfeeding (AHR = 4.82; 95\% CI:  1.40-16.65) were independent predictors of mortality among neonates with sepsis.  CONCLUSIONS: Almost one in five neonates with sepsis died at discharge. Low  birthweight, maternal age {$\geq$} 35 years, low fifth-minute Apgar score, and late  initiation of breastfeeding were predictors of mortality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rates of hospital readmissions are used as indicators of quality of health care. Yet specific causes of readmissions have not been sufficiently studied and an unified definition of such an indicator is lacking. Our goal was to determine the causes and potential avoidability of readmissions in our hospital and to identify a suitable definition of this indicator. PATIENTS AND METHOD: DESIGN: Cross sectional study. SETTING: Hospital Costa del Sol (Marbella, M{\'a}laga). Subjects of study: Random sample of hospital discharges followed by a new admission within the next 6 months (n = 363). INTERVENTIONS: Determination of the causes and potential avoidability of readmissions, by means of a peer-review of medical records. Descriptive and logistic regression analysis of the variables contained in the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) and related to the avoidability of readmissions. RESULTS: 19\% (95\% CI: 15.0-23.0) of hospital readmissions within 6 months after hospital discharge were attributed to potentially avoidable situations if the applied medical care had been modified during the previous episode. This figure reached 37\% (95\% CI: 27.4-47.3) for surgical services, 13\% (95\% CI: 8.7-17.6) for medical services and 12\% (95\% CI: 2.9-20.6) for obstetrics. The MBDS variables related to the potential avoidability of readmissions were, for the whole hospital, 1) the shorter interval from the previous discharge and 2) the difference of diagnosis between both episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Most hospital readmissions are due to non-avoidable situations if the applied medical care had been modified during the previous episode. In order to detect potentially avoidable situations, definitions of readmission rates should only include early readmissions with a chief diagnosis other than that in the previous admission.},

While Chinese immigrants face increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) after migration, the reasons are not well understood. Method: This descriptive qualitative study collected 18 semistructured interviews with Chinese immigrants with CHD and family carers from two Australian hospitals. Analysis was guided by the social-ecological model. Results: Poor knowledge and limited English proficiency increased CHD risk and difficulty navigating health care systems/resources. Interpersonal and family factors positively influenced health-seeking behaviors, acceptance of cardiac procedures, adoption of secondary preventive behaviors and information acquisition through social networks. A lack of culturally specific health information and programs in Chinese languages was described. Ethnic concordance between Chinese doctors and patients improved health literacy and engendered trust. Discussion: Culturally specific interventions could include health promotion materials in Chinese, inclusion of family in educational programs, and Chinese-focused public health campaigns about warning signs of heart attack.},

This article reports on a study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a programme of enhanced primary care support intended to reduce the risk of hospital admission for people aged 75 years and above. Nineteen patients out of a possible 322 in one GP practice were judged by GPs and district nurses to be "at risk" of avoidable hospital admission. All at-risk patients were visited by a GP or district nurse to review their needs for enhanced support, six patients subsequently accepting a referral for additional support. No statistically significant difference in the number of hospital admissions in the intervention group was observed compared with a group of patients with similar demographic characteristics but deemed not to be at such high risk, suggesting that the intervention might have been effective in reducing the number of avoidable hospital admissions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Demographic risk factors for multimorbidity have been identified in numerous population-based studies of older adults; however, there is less data on younger populations, despite the fact that approximately 24\% of US adults age 18+ have multimorbidity. Understanding multimorbidity earlier in the life course is critical because of the increased likelihood of long-term disability and loss of productivity associated with chronic disease progression. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of education and race/ethnicity with mutimorbidity among adults aged 30-64 using cross-sectional data from the 2002-2014 National Health Interview Surveys. DESIGN: Multimorbidity was defined as having at least 2 of 9 self-reported health conditions. Educational attainment was categorized as less than high school (HS), completed HS or some college, and bachelor's degree or higher. Logistic regression models of multimorbidity controlled for time since last doctor's visit, demographic and socioeconomic measures. RESULTS: Compared to having a bachelor's degree or higher, completing less than HS (OR=1.58, 95\% CI = 1.50-1.66) or HS/some college (OR=1.32, 95\% CI = 1.27-1.37) were both associated with increased odds of multimorbidity net of all included covariates. Non-Hispanic Blacks had greater odds of multimorbidity (OR=1.07, 95\% CI = 1.02-1.11) compared to Non-Hispanic Whites with comparable characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiologic and demographic research on the burden of multimorbidity among non-elderly adults is limited, but warrants renewed attention given the potential for long-term loss of quality of life, productivity, and well-being for non-elderly adults. Reducing multimorbidity through health promotion efforts across the socioeconomic spectrum and earlier in the life course will be a requirement to age successfully and support overall well-being in the aging US population.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Understanding whether and why there are racial disparities in readmissions has implications for efforts to reduce readmissions. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether black patients have higher odds of readmission than white patients and whether these disparities are related to where black patients receive care. DESIGN: Using national Medicare data, we examined 30-day readmissions after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and pneumonia. We categorized hospitals in the top decile of proportion of black patients as minority-serving. We determined the odds of readmission for black patients compared with white patients at minority-serving vs non-minority-serving hospitals. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Medicare Provider Analysis Review files of more than 3.1 million Medicare fee-for-service recipients who were discharged from US hospitals in 2006-2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Risk-adjusted odds of 30-day readmission. RESULTS: Overall, black patients had higher readmission rates than white patients (24.8\% vs 22.6\%, odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.14; P {$<$} .001); patients from minority-serving hospitals had higher readmission rates than those from non-minority-serving hospitals (25.5\% vs 22.0\%, OR, 1.23; 95\% CI, 1.20-1.27; P {$<$} .001). Among patients with acute MI and using white patients from non-minority-serving hospitals as the reference group (readmission rate 20.9\%), black patients from minority-serving hospitals had the highest readmission rate (26.4\%; OR, 1.35; 95\% CI, 1.28-1.42), while white patients from minority-serving hospitals had a 24.6\% readmission rate (OR, 1.23; 95\% CI, 1.18-1.29) and black patients from non-minority-serving hospitals had a 23.3\% readmission rate (OR, 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.16-1.23; P {$<$} .001 for each); patterns were similar for CHF and pneumonia. The results were unchanged after adjusting for hospital characteristics including markers of caring for poor patients. CONCLUSION: Among elderly Medicare recipients, black patients were more likely to be readmitted after hospitalization for 3 common conditions, a gap that was related to both race and to the site where care was received.},

  abstract = {Background: Reducing readmissions for heart failure (HF) is an important goal for policymakers. Current national policies financially penalize hospitals with high readmission rates, which may have unintended consequences if these institutions are resource-poor, either financially or clinically. Methods and Results: We analyzed national claims data for Medicare patients discharged from U.S. hospitals in 2006--2007 with HF. We used multivariable models to examine hospital characteristics, 30-day all-cause readmission rates, and likelihood of performing in the worst quartile of readmission rates nationally. Among 905,764 discharges in our sample, patients discharged from public hospitals (27.9\%) had higher readmission rates than non-profit hospitals (25.7\%, p{$<$}0.001), as did patients discharged from hospitals in counties with low median income (29.4\%) compared to counties with high median income (25.7\%, p{$<$}0.001). Patients discharged from hospitals without cardiac services (27.2\%) had higher readmission rates than those from hospitals with full cardiac services (25.1\%, p{$<$}0.001); patients discharged from hospitals in the lowest quartile of nurse staffing (28.5\%) had higher readmission rates than those from hospitals in the highest quartile (25.4\%, p{$<$}0.001). Patients discharged from small hospitals (28.4\%) had higher readmission rates than those discharged from large hospitals (25.2\%, p{$<$}0.001). These same characteristics identified hospitals which were likely to perform in the worst quartile nationally. Conclusions: Given that many poor-performing hospitals also have fewer resources, they may suffer disproportionately from financial penalties for high readmission rates. As we seek to improve care for HF patients, we should ensure that penalties for poor performance do not worsen disparities in quality of care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased use of drugs has raised concern about the risks of polypharmacy in elderly populations. Adverse outcomes, such as hospitalizations and falls, have been shown to be associated with polypharmacy. So far, little information is available on the association between polypharmacy status and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether polypharmacy (six to nine drugs) or excessive polypharmacy (ten or more drugs) could be indicators of mortality in elderly persons. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study conducted between 1998 and 2003 with mortality follow-up through to 2007. The data in this study were derived from the population-based Kuopio 75+ Study, which involved elderly persons aged{$>$}or=75 years living in the city of Kuopio, Finland. The initial sample (sample frame n=4518, random sample n=700) was drawn from the population register. For the purpose of this study, two separate analyses were carried out. In the first phase, participants (aged{$>$}or=75 years, n=601) were followed from 1998 (baseline) to 2002. In the second phase, survivors (aged{$>$}or=80 years, n=339) were followed from 2003 to 2007. Current medications were determined from drug containers and prescriptions during interviews conducted by a trained nurse. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to examine the association between polypharmacy status and mortality. RESULTS: In the first phase, 28\% (n=167) belonged to the excessive polypharmacy group, 33\% (n=200) to the polypharmacy group, and the remaining 39\% (n=234) to the non-polypharmacy (0-5 drugs) group. The corresponding figures in the second phase were 28\% (n=95), 39\% (n=132) and 33\% (n=112), respectively. The mortality rate was 37\% in the first phase and 40\% in the second phase. In both phases, the survival curves showed a significant difference in all-cause mortality between the three polypharmacy groups. In the first phase, the univariate model showed an association between excessive polypharmacy and mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2.53, 95\% CI 1.83, 3.48); however, after adjustment for demographics and other variables measuring functional and cognitive status, this association did not remain statistically significant (HR 1.28, 95\% CI 0.86, 1.91). In the second phase, the association between excessive polypharmacy and mortality (HR 2.23, 95\% CI 1.21, 4.12) remained significant after adjustments. Age, male sex and dependency according to the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living screening instrument were associated with mortality in both phases. CONCLUSION: This study points to the importance of excessive polypharmacy as an indicator for mortality in elderly persons. This association needs to be confirmed following adjustment for co-morbidities.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Increasing use of drugs among elderly people has raised concerns about possible negative health outcomes, including malnutrition, associated with polypharmacy. Evidence about the association of polypharmacy with nutritional status is scarce. This review summarizes the relevant evidence regarding polypharmacy and nutritional status in elderly people. RECENT FINDINGS: The probability of nutritional problems as a consequence of drugs is highest in elderly people suffering from several diseases. Drug treatment may contribute to poor nutritional status by causing loss of appetite, gastrointestinal problems, and other alterations in body function. Some recently published studies add evidence on possible association between increasing number of drugs and malnutrition. Studies indicate also an association between polypharmacy and weight changes. In addition, there are available studies that have shown deficits in the intake of specific macronutrients and micronutrients (e.g. fiber, glucose, and specific vitamins) for those with a high number of drugs in use. SUMMARY: On the basis of available evidence, the role of polypharmacy on nutritional status among elderly people is unclear. Some diseases promote malnutrition; thus, the independent role of drugs for nutritional status is challenging to determine. Longitudinal studies with careful adjustment for underlying diseases are needed to explore association between polypharmacy and malnutrition. Nutritional evaluation should be a routine part of comprehensive geriatric assessment that is conducted ideally in multiprofessional teams, including physician, pharmacist, and dietitian.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, there is scanty data on the causes of neonatal sepsis and antimicrobial resistance among common invasive pathogens that might  guide policy and practice. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational prevalence  and etiology study of neonates with suspected sepsis admitted to the neonatal  intensive care unit, University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia, between  October 2013 and May 2014. Data from blood cultures and phenotypic antibiotic  susceptibility testing were compared with multivariate analysis of risk factors  for neonatal sepsis. RESULTS: Of 313 neonates with suspected sepsis, 54\%  (170/313) were male; 20\% (62/313) were born to HIV-positive mothers; 33\%  (103/313) had positive blood cultures, of which 85\% (88/103) were early-onset  sepsis. Klebsiella species was the most prevalent isolate, accounting for 75\%  (77/103) of cases, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci [6\% (7/103)],  Staphylococcus aureus [6\% (6/103)], Escherichia coli [5\% (5/103)] and Candida  species [5\% (5/103)]. For Klebsiella species, antibiotic resistance ranged from  96\%-99\% for World Health Organization-recommended first-line therapy (gentamicin  and ampicillin/penicillin) to 94\%-97\% for third-generation cephalosporins. The  prevalence of culture-confirmed sepsis increased from 0 to 39\% during the period  December 2013 to March 2014, during which time mortality increased 29\%-47\%; 93\%  (14/15) of late-onset sepsis and 82\% (37/45) of early-onset sepsis aged 4-7 days  were admitted {$>$}2 days before the onset of symptoms. Culture results for only 25\%  (26/103) of cases were available before discharge or death. Maternal HIV  infection was associated with a reduced risk of neonatal sepsis [odds ratio, 0.46  (0.23-0.93); P = 0.029]. CONCLUSIONS: Outbreaks of nosocomial  multiantibiotic-resistant infections are an important cause of neonatal sepsis  and associated mortality. Reduced risk of neonatal sepsis associated with  maternal HIV infection is counterintuitive and requires further investigation.},

We evaluated the impact of frailty on readmission or death within 30 days after discharge from general internal medicine wards. METHODS We prospectively enrolled patients discharged from 7 medical wards at 2 teaching hospitals in Edmonton. Frailty was defined by means of the previously validated Clinical Frailty Scale. The primary outcome was the composite of readmission or death within 30 days after discharge. RESULTS Of the 495 patients included in the study, 162 (33\%) met the definition of frailty: 91 (18\%) had mild, 60 (12\%) had moderate, and 11 (2\%) had severe frailty. Frail patients were older, had more comorbidities, lower quality of life, and higher LACE scores at discharge than those who were not frail. The composite of 30-day readmission or death was higher among frail than among nonfrail patients (39 [24.1\%] v. 46 [13.8\%]). Although frailty added additional prognostic information to predictive models that included age, sex and LACE score, only moderate to severe frailty (31.0\% event rate) was an independent risk factor for readmission or death (adjusted odds ratio 2.19, 95\% confidence interval 1.12-4.24). INTERPRETATION Frailty was common and associated with a substantially increased risk of early readmission or death after discharge from medical wards. The Clinical Frailty Scale could be useful in identifying high-risk patients being discharged from general internal medicine wards.},

RESULTS: At baseline, married people suffered from fewer subsequent functional limitations than the unmarried. Moreover, limited evidence suggests the influence of depressive symptoms was greater for the married than the unmarried; however, the influence of chronic conditions was consistently attenuated for married people. Accounting for differences in prior health, work, socioeconomic status, and health behaviors did not explain the moderating influence of marital status on the associations between symptoms of depression and chronic conditions with functional limitations. DISCUSSION: This research highlights the need to identify potential modifiers that may help disrupt the process of disablement among both the married and the unmarried alike.},

Screening at an emergency department (ED) should be handled in just a few minutes without the use of tests or measurements. The FRESH-screening was developed for this purpose. This study's aim was to evaluate the FRESH-screening and its construct validity; also assessed were the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values for frailty screening. METHODS: The study had a cross-sectional design. A total of 161 elderly people who sought care at the emergency department at Molndal Hospital were included. Inclusion criteria were ages {$>$}/=80 years or ages 65-79 with at least one chronic disease and dependence in at least one daily living activity. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated to describe the accuracy of the FRESH-screening in identifying those with frailty, as assessed by eight frailty indicators. Sensitivity and specificity were both set at a minimum of 80 \%, and a percentage sum {$>$}/=150 of the sensitivity and positive prediction was considered a measure of excellent value. RESULT: Both sensitivity and specificity were high (81 \% and 80 \%, respectively) when comparing the four questions of the FRESH-screening against the eight frailty indicators. The percentage sum of sensitivity and positive prediction was 173 (81 \% + 92 \%), thus exceeding the 150 cutoff. CONCLUSION: This study shows the FRESH-screening to be of excellent clinical value. Additionally, the clinical experience is that the instrument is simple and rapid to use, takes only a few minutes to administer, and requires minimal energy input by older persons.},

Although the World Health Organization (WHO)  reports that over 80\% of these sepsis deaths could be prevented through improved  treatment, the efficacy of the currently recommended first- and second-line  treatment regimens for this condition is increasingly affected by high rates of  drug resistance. Here we assess three well known antibiotics, fosfomycin,  flomoxef and amikacin, in combination as potential antibiotic treatment regimens  by investigating the drug resistance and genetic profiles of commonly isolated  GNB causing neonatal sepsis in LMICs. The five most prevalent bacterial isolates  in the NeoOBS study (NCT03721302) are Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter  baumannii, E. coli, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae complex. Among  these isolates, high levels of ESBL and carbapenemase encoding genes are detected  along with resistance to ampicillin, gentamicin and cefotaxime, the current WHO  recommended empiric regimens. The three new combinations show excellent in vitro  activity against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates. Our data  should further inform and support the clinical evaluation of these three  antibiotic combinations for the treatment of neonatal sepsis in areas with high  rates of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.},

  abstract = {To create a systematic synthesis of the published evidence about the prevalence of eight geriatric syndromes and their association with survival and institutionalization, and to provide a review of models that report survival in elderly populations., Original epidemiologic studies were sought from several databases to identify articles published in English from January 1, 1990 to April 25, 2010., We identified studies of multiple morbidities, mild cognitive impairment, frailty, disability, sarcopenia, malnutrition, homeostenosis (i.e., impaired homeostasis), and chronic inflammation in the general elderly population and age, race, and sex subgroups. We developed standardized forms using different definitions of these syndromes and abstracted prevalence of the syndromes. Multivariate adjusted risks of mortality and institutionalization for elderly patients with syndromes were abstracted to calculate remaining life expectancy. Pooled analyses were conducted with random effects models. Statistical and decisionmaking models were appraised for content, simplicity, and validation., Of the 2,377 publications retrieved, 509 publications of 123 studies were eligible for review. Definitions varied within each syndrome and overlapped across all syndromes. Prevalence estimates increased with age. African Americans had higher prevalence of multiple morbidities, frailty, malnutrition, and disability when compared to Caucasians. Evidence on other minority subgroups was sparse. All syndromes were associated with increased risk of death and institutionalization. A negative association between prevalence of a syndrome and its effect on survival was evident across all syndromes. Impaired homeostasis and dementia were associated with the lowest survival among elderly persons when compared to the general population. In the young-old, ages 65--74 years, those with homeostenosis, poor health, or advanced dementia suffered significant decreases in predicted life expectancy. The syndromes affected the likelihood of death more among the young-old. In those older than age 90 years, the added value of factoring in conditions and syndromes to evaluate the link to mortality beyond 1 year was minimal. Complexity was not associated with better mortality models in elderly persons., Syndromes are not independent; definitions and prevalence estimates overlap substantially. Some minority subpopulations had higher prevalence of the syndromes. Less inclusive definitions had lower prevalence but were better predictors of outcomes. Complex mortality models added less benefit to simpler models that included age, specific diseases, and impact on overall health and functioning. For younger old persons, syndromes most strongly linked to mortality were homeostenosis, poor health, and dementia.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Predicting hospital readmission risk is of great interest to identify which patients would benefit most from care transition interventions, as well as to risk-adjust readmission rates for the purposes of hospital comparison. OBJECTIVE: To summarize validated readmission risk prediction models, describe their performance, and assess suitability for clinical or administrative use. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: The databases of MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception through March 2011, the EMBASE database was searched through August 2011, and hand searches were performed of the retrieved reference lists. Dual review was conducted to identify studies published in the English language of prediction models tested with medical patients in both derivation and validation cohorts. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted on the population, setting, sample size, follow-up interval, readmission rate, model discrimination and calibration, type of data used, and timing of data collection. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 7843 citations reviewed, 30 studies of 26 unique models met the inclusion criteria. The most common outcome used was 30-day readmission; only 1 model specifically addressed preventable readmissions. Fourteen models that relied on retrospective administrative data could be potentially used to risk-adjust readmission rates for hospital comparison; of these, 9 were tested in large US populations and had poor discriminative ability (c statistic range: 0.55-0.65). Seven models could potentially be used to identify high-risk patients for intervention early during a hospitalization (c statistic range: 0.56-0.72), and 5 could be used at hospital discharge (c statistic range: 0.68-0.83). Six studies compared different models in the same population and 2 of these found that functional and social variables improved model discrimination. Although most models incorporated variables for medical comorbidity and use of prior medical services, few examined variables associated with overall health and function, illness severity, or social determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: Most current readmission risk prediction models that were designed for either comparative or clinical purposes perform poorly. Although in certain settings such models may prove useful, efforts to improve their performance are needed as use becomes more widespread.},

We investigated the association between body mass index (BMI) in young men and subsequent type 2 diabetes and how, in diagnosed diabetes, adolescent BMI relates to glycemic control and diabetes complications. Methods Baseline data from the Swedish Conscript Register for men drafted 1968--2005 was combined with data from the National Diabetes and Patient registries. Diabetes risk was estimated through Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. Relationships between BMI, glycemic control and diabetes complications were assessed through multiple linear and logistic regression. Findings Among~1,647,826 men, 63,957 (3{$\cdot$}88\%) developed type 2 diabetes over a median follow-up of 29.0 years (IQR[21.0--37.0]). The risk of diabetes within 40 years after conscription was nearly 40\% in individuals with adolescent BMI~{$\geq$}35~kg/m2. Compared to BMI 18{$\cdot$}5--{$<$}20~kg/m2 (reference), diabetes risk increased in a linear fashion from HR 1{$\cdot$}18(95\%CI 1{$\cdot$}15--1{$\cdot$}21) for BMI 20--{$<$}22{$\cdot$}5~kg/m2 to HR 15{$\cdot$}93(95\%CI 14{$\cdot$}88--17{$\cdot$}05) for BMI {$\geq$}35~kg/m2, and a difference in age at onset of 11{$\cdot$}4 years was seen. Among men who developed diabetes, higher adolescent BMI was associated with higher HbA1c levels and albuminuria rates. Interpretation Rising adolescent BMI was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes diagnosed at a younger age, with poorer metabolic control, and a greater prevalence of albuminuria, all suggestive of worse prognosis.},

  abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To obtain a deeper understanding of the persistent use of telecare for older adults and their family caregivers. BACKGROUND: Telecare is seen as part of the solution in home care services for ageing in place. Previous studies have shown that telecare is a complex intervention, and there is still a poor understanding of older adults' and their family caregivers' experience with the use of telecare. DESIGN: This study used a qualitative hermeneutic research approach. METHOD: Interviews were conducted with 18 older adults and follow-up interviews were conducted with 15 participants after 5-6~months of use. In addition, interviews were conducted with seven close family caregivers. The COREQ checklist was used. RESULTS: The older adults expressed increased safety, security and independence. Although some of them experienced challenges, they continued to use the services. Furthermore, the findings revealed needs that telecare could not cover. Family caregivers reported that telecare eased their concern for a time. However, they felt increased responsibility which led to ambivalent feelings between wanting to comply with the older adults' desire to live at home and the stress and concern this caused. CONCLUSION: Telecare does improve care offered by home care services. However, it must be considered in the context of assistance and other measures and be provided in response to each individual's specific needs. Family caregivers may benefit from telecare, but telecare may also add to their care burden. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: There is a need for increased knowledge and information about telecare and for follow-up from home care services. Family caregivers are important for promoting sustainable use, but a support system and better cooperation with home care services is needed.},

METHODS: In this review, we evaluate programmes that in randomized controlled trials (RCT) have been shown with fall reducing effect. RESULTS: Physical exercise that includes several training modalities, especially balance and strength training, is the only intervention programme that reduces both the number of fallers and the number of falls in community dwellers. Home hazards modification reduces the fall risk in community-living elderly but has the best effects in high risk groups when the programme is led by occupational therapists. Vitamin D supplement in those with low levels of vitamin D, adjustment of psychotropic medication and modification of multi-pharmacy are drug-related programmes that reduce the fall risk. Anti-slip shoe devices in elderly who walk outdoors during icy conditions and multifaceted podiatry to patients with specific foot disability are interventions targeted at the lower extremities with a fall-reducing effect. First eye cataract surgery and pacemakers in patients with cardio-inhibitory carotid sinus hypersensitivity are surgical procedures with fall-reducing effect. Multifactorial standardized preventive programmes that include an exercise component and individually-designed subject-specific programmes also reduce the number of falls. CONCLUSIONS: Fall preventive interventions should be provided to elderly by a structured approach, especially to high risk groups, as to reduce the number of falls and fallers.},

For our analysis we use high quality administrative data from Sweden. Our analysis is based on fixed effects estimates. We use our findings to project future LTC expenditures and show that, although TTD is a relevant predictor, age itself remains the main driver of LTC expenditures.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sepsis is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity among neonates. An estimated 5.29-8.73\,million Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)  are lost annually in SSA due to neonatal sepsis (NS). Uganda registered stagnated  neonatal mortality of 27 deaths per 1000 live births in 2020 of which 12\% was  attributed to NS. Early risk factor identification and improved obstetric care  are proven to reduce deaths due to NS, yet there is scanty literature on the  LRRH. We, therefore, determined the prevalence of NS and identified its  associated factors within the LRRH of northern Uganda. METHODS: A hospital-based,  cross-sectional study with a retrospective chart review was conducted in the  neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Lira Regional Referral Hospital (LRRH), in  northern Uganda. 194 records of neonates admitted to the NICU from September 2022  to February 2023 were reviewed. The participant records were selected by  systematic sampling technique and a structured data extraction tool was used to  collect data. Using SPSS version 25 data entry and analysis were done. The  univariable analysis gave a general description of the data. Logistic regression  analysis was used to show associations and the statistical significance was  declared at a P value of 0.05 after multivariable analysis. RESULTS: Among a  total of 194 neonates whose charts were reviewed, 80 neonates had neonatal  sepsis, giving a proportion of 0.412 and then prevalence of 41.2\%. Age in days of  the neonate (AOR = 4.212, 95\% CI: [1.627-10.903]) for neonates of 1-3days of age,  sex where males (AOR = 2.09, 95\% CI: [1.123-3.887]), an APGAR score of 1-4 at  birth (AOR = 0.309, 95\% CI: [0.115-0.831]) and weight at birth {$<$}2500g (AOR =  2.543, 95\% CI: [1.381-4.683]) were significantly related to it. CONCLUSIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS: The results found the prevalence of NS among neonates admitted  to the NICU of LRRH high at 41.2\%. Factors 1-3 days of age, male sex, a birth  weight of {$<$}2500g, and an Apgar score of 1-4 at birth among all neonates were  significant. Therefore, it was suggested that caregivers ensure safe newborn  care, detect infections early, and use prophylactic antibiotics for high-risk  babies after birth, to reduce NS. Further research will be conducted on the major  causative agents and outcomes of NS in the NICU of LRRH.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The high-risk population and current lack of knowledge regarding appropriate infection prevention in the long-term care (LTC) setting has contributed to substantial rates of resistance and healthcare-associated infections in this arena. More evidence-based research on LTC is necessary, particularly now that the elderly population is increasing. RECENT FINDINGS: Proposed government mandates highlight the urgent need to combat antimicrobial resistance in the LTC setting. Recent studies focusing on unique strategies for the prevention of transmission and infection with multidrug-resistant organisms in nursing homes are discussed, as well as attempts to formulate clear antimicrobial stewardship programs. SUMMARY: The long-term setting has unique challenges to instituting effective infection control precautions, therefore current accepted methods used in acute-care facilities need to be modified. Recent data suggest that prevention of transmission in LTC may be achieved with focus on high-risk patients or specific care-based activities rather than colonization status. Antimicrobial stewardship and consultation with specialized physicians may be important measures to combat resistance and adverse events in LTC. The prevention of unnecessary antibiotic use in palliative care may reduce rates of resistance as well as discomfort for terminal patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is one of the most important causes of mortality in developing countries and yet the most preventable. In developing countries  clinical algorithms are used to diagnose clinical neonatal sepsis because of  inadequate microbiological services. Most information on incidence and risk  factors of neonatal sepsis are from hospital studies which may not be generalized  to communities where a significant proportion of mothers do not deliver from  health facilities. This study, conducted in urban Uganda, sought to determine the  community based incidence of clinical neonatal sepsis and the factors associated.  METHODS: This was a cohort of mother-neonate pairs in Kampala, Uganda from March  to May 2012. The enrolled neonates were assessed for clinical sepsis and factors  associated, and followed up till the end of the neonatal period. STATA version 10  was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: The community based incidence of neonatal  sepsis was 11\% (95\% CI: 7.6-14.4). On bivariate analysis, lack of financial  support from the father (OR 4.09, 95\% CI 1.60-10.39) and prolonged rupture of  membranes more than 18~h prior to delivery (OR 11.7, 95\% CI 4.0-31.83) were  significantly associated with neonatal sepsis. Maternal hand washing prior to  handling the baby was found to be protective of neonatal sepsis (OR 0.41, 95\% CI  0.18-0.94). Of the 317 infants who completed the follow up period, one died  within the neonatal period giving a neonatal mortality of 0.003\%. CONCLUSION: The  high incidence of clinical neonatal sepsis in this urban community with high  rates of antenatal care attendance and health facility delivery places a demand  on the need to improve the quality of antenatal, perinatal and postnatal care in  health facilities with regards to infection prevention including promoting simple  practices like hand washing. The astoundingly low mortality rate is most likely  because this was a low risk cohort. However it may also suggest that the neonatal  mortality in developing countries may be reduced with promotion of simple low  cost interventions like community follow up of neonates using village health  teams or domiciliary care.},

It expands on earlier frameworks of dyadic coping by presenting a model that views dyadic coping as a process that varies according to how couples appraise the illness- related stress, communicate about it, coordinate their coping efforts, and make meaning from the illness experience. In-depth analyses were conducted on interviews with 10 couples who were coping with breast cancer. A qualitative method that comprises a series of "listenings" to the couples' experiences was used to examine how couples talked about their stress and coping efforts. Two patterns of relational coping were identified: mutually responsiveness and disengaged avoidance. The relational qualities of relationship awareness, authenticity, and mutuality were identified as important ingredients for dyadic coping. Suggestions for future research that furthers our understanding of relational coping are offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that mass distribution of a broad-spectrum antibiotic agent to preschool children would reduce mortality in areas of sub-Saharan Africa that are currently far from meeting the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. METHODS: In this cluster-randomized trial, we assigned communities in Malawi, Niger, and Tanzania to four twice-yearly mass distributions of either oral azithromycin (approximately 20 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. Children 1 to 59 months of age were identified in twice-yearly censuses and were offered participation in the trial. Vital status was determined at subsequent censuses. The primary outcome was aggregate all-cause mortality; country-specific rates were assessed in prespecified subgroup analyses. RESULTS: A total of 1533 communities underwent randomization, 190,238 children were identified in the census at baseline, and 323,302 person-years were monitored. The mean (+/-SD) azithromycin and placebo coverage over the four twice-yearly distributions was 90.4+/-10.4\%. The overall annual mortality rate was 14.6 deaths per 1000 person-years in communities that received azithromycin (9.1 in Malawi, 22.5 in Niger, and 5.4 in Tanzania) and 16.5 deaths per 1000 person-years in communities that received placebo (9.6 in Malawi, 27.5 in Niger, and 5.5 in Tanzania). Mortality was 13.5\% lower overall (95\% confidence interval [CI], 6.7 to 19.8) in communities that received azithromycin than in communities that received placebo (P{$<$}0.001); the rate was 5.7\% lower in Malawi (95\% CI, -9.7 to 18.9), 18.1\% lower in Niger (95\% CI, 10.0 to 25.5), and 3.4\% lower in Tanzania (95\% CI, -21.2 to 23.0). Children in the age group of 1 to 5 months had the greatest effect from azithromycin (24.9\% lower mortality than that with placebo; 95\% CI, 10.6 to 37.0). Serious adverse events occurring within a week after administration of the trial drug or placebo were uncommon, and the rate did not differ significantly between the groups. Evaluation of selection for antibiotic resistance is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: Among postneonatal, preschool children in sub-Saharan Africa, childhood mortality was lower in communities randomly assigned to mass distribution of azithromycin than in those assigned to placebo, with the largest effect seen in Niger. Any implementation of a policy of mass distribution would need to strongly consider the potential effect of such a strategy on antibiotic resistance.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Antibiotic Guardian Campaign was developed to increase commitment to reducing Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), change behaviour and increase knowledge through an online pledge system for healthcare professionals and members of the public to become Antibiotic Guardians (AG). This qualitative evaluation aimed to understand AG experiences of the campaign and perceived impact on behaviour. METHODS: Ninety-four AGs (48 via a survey and 46 who had agreed to future contact) were invited to participate in a telephone semi-structured interview. The sample was based on self-identification as a healthcare professional or a member of the public, pledge group (e.g. adults, primary care prescribers etc.), pledge and gender. Interviews explored how participants became aware of the campaign, reasons for joining, pledge choices, responses to joining and views about the campaign's implementation. Interviews were analysed using the Framework Method. RESULTS: Twenty-two AGs (10 healthcare professionals and 12 members of the public) were interviewed. AGs became aware of the campaign through professional networks and social media, and were motivated to join by personal and professional concern for AMR. Choice of pledge group and pledge were attributed to relevance and potential impact on AMR and the behaviour of others through pledge enactment and promotion of the campaign. Most AGs could not recall their pledge unprompted. Most felt they fulfilled their pledge, although this reflected either behaviour change or the pledge reinforcing pre-existing behaviour. The campaign triggered AGs to reflect on AMR related behaviour and reinforced pre-existing beliefs. Several AGs promoted the campaign to others. Responding collectively as part of the campaign was thought to have a greater impact than individual action. However, limited campaign visibility was observed and the campaign was perceived to have restricted ability to reach those unaware of AMR. CONCLUSIONS: AGs were motivated to reduce AMR and most felt they fulfilled their pledges although for many this appeared to be through reinforcement of existing behaviours. We recommend that the campaign engages those without pre-existing knowledge of AMR by increasing its visibility, capitalising on the diffusion of its message and including more awareness-raising content for those with limited AMR knowledge.},

  abstract = {Introduction Resistin is a proinflammatory hormone recently proposed as a sepsis biomarker. Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic values of this  marker in neonatal sepsis. Methods This is a prospective observational study that  includes 60 term and late preterm neonates with proven and possible sepsis  besides 30 healthy controls. Resistin and other biomarkers, like C-reactive  protein (CRP), were measured within 2 h of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)  admission. Infants were monitored and the primary outcome was 30-day mortality.  Results Resistin was higher among septic neonates compared with controls  (P{$<$}0.001). Resistin had an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)  curve of 0.994 for differentiating septic infants from controls. The area under  the curve (AUC) for differentiating infants with culture-proven sepsis from  controls was 0.999 compared with an AUC of 1 for CRP. The other markers, like  platelet count, were inferior to resistin and CRP. Resistin was positively  correlated with CRP [Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs)=0.55, P{$<$}0.001]. No  significant differences in resistin levels were noted between survivors and  non-survivors but resistin was higher among infants with severe sepsis (P=0.015)  and among those who needed mechanical ventilation (P{$<$}0.001). Conclusion Resistin  is useful for the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Resistin failed to predict  mortality but was associated with indicators of disease severity.},

  abstract = {A key public health need is to identify individuals at high risk for a given disease to enable enhanced screening or preventive therapies. Because most common diseases have a genetic component, one important approach is to stratify individuals based on inherited DNA variation1. Proposed clinical applications have largely focused on finding carriers of rare monogenic mutations at several-fold increased risk. Although most disease risk is polygenic in nature2-5, it has not yet been possible to use polygenic predictors to identify individuals at risk comparable to monogenic mutations. Here, we develop and validate genome-wide polygenic scores for five common diseases. The approach identifies 8.0, 6.1, 3.5, 3.2, and 1.5\% of the population at greater than threefold increased risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and breast cancer, respectively. For coronary artery disease, this prevalence is 20-fold higher than the carrier frequency of rare monogenic mutations conferring comparable risk6. We propose that it is time to contemplate the inclusion of polygenic risk prediction in clinical care, and discuss relevant issues.},

  abstract = {A high rate of polypharmacy is, in part, a consequence of the increasing proportion of multimorbidity in the ageing population worldwide. Our understanding of the potential harm of taking multiple medications in an older, multi-morbid population, who are likely to be on a polypharmacy regime, is limited. This is a narrative literature review that aims to appraise and summarise recent studies published about polypharmacy. We searched MEDLINE using the search terms polypharmacy (and its variations, e.g. multiple prescriptions, inappropriate drug use, etc.) in titles. Systematic reviews and original studies in English published between 2003 and 2018 were included. In this review, we provide current definitions of polypharmacy. We identify the determinants and prevalence of polypharmacy reported in different studies. Finally, we summarise some of the findings regarding the association between polypharmacy and health outcomes in older adults, with a focus on frailty, hospitalisation and mortality. Polypharmacy was most often defined in terms of the number of medications that are being taken by an individual at any given time. Our review showed that the prevalence of polypharmacy varied between 10\% to as high as around 90\% in different populations. Chronic conditions, demographics, socioeconomics and self-assessed health factors were independent predictors of polypharmacy. Polypharmacy was reported to be associated with various adverse outcomes after adjusting for health conditions. Optimising care for polypharmacy with valid, reliable measures, relevant to all patients, will improve the health outcomes of older adult population.},

METHODS: Searches were conducted on Medline, PsychINFO, InFoTrac One File Plus, Sociological Abstracts, and Dissertation Abstracts through 2004. The following keywords were used: patient preferred and received information; patient preferred and actualized treatment decision-making; patient-physician beliefs in shared decision-making; patient-physician match, fit, or concordance; reciprocal relationship or mutuality; doctor-patient affiliation, control, relationship; match/fit between patient and physician in affiliation, control, or relationship. RESULTS: Findings revealed varying degrees of support for the positive effects of matching patients' preferred levels of information, decisional control, and consultative interpersonal behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Findings justify not only continued but expanded research efforts in this area that would incorporate recommended changes in research design and implementation. PRACTICE AND RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: Assessment strategies and match interventions are discussed that, if evidence continues to be supportive, might routinely optimize patient-physician encounters toward more positive outcomes. Methodological guidelines are suggested that can improve future preference-match studies of the patient-physician interaction. Practitioners need to consider adoption of patient-match assessment and intervention strategies in addition to recent exclusive concentrations on patient-centered and shared decision-making approaches.},

RESULTS: A high proportion of older adults were unable to read and understand written basic medical instructions. Only 40-50\% were able to comprehend directions for taking medication four times a day or on an empty stomach. Only 11-38\% were able to understand information regarding treatment procedure, informed consent, or educational material for elderly fall prevention. Individuals who were older, single, and had less education and income were more likely to have lower functional health literacy. After adjusting for sociodemographic variables, individuals with lower health literacy had poorly perceived health status. CONCLUSION: Many Korean older adults have a very low level of functional literacy. Low health literacy was independently associated with poorly perceived health status.},

DESIGN A population-based, secondary analysis using multilevel causal modeling. SETTING Acute care hospitals in California in the USA. PARTICIPANTS In total, 509 775 patients aged 50 or older who were discharged alive from acute care hospitals (index hospitalizations), and 59 566 who had a rehospitalization within 30 days following their index discharge. INTERVENTION No intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Thirty-day unplanned readmissions to a different hospital compared with the same hospital and also the costs and health outcomes of the readmissions. RESULTS Twenty-one percent of patients with a rehospitalization had a different-hospital readmission. Compared with the same-hospital readmission group, the different-hospital readmission group was more likely to be younger, male and have a lower income. The index hospitals of the different-hospital readmission group were more likely to be smaller, for-profit hospitals, which were also more likely to be located in counties with higher competition. The different-hospital readmission group had higher odds for in-hospital death (8.1 vs. 6.7\%; P {$<$} 0.0001) and greater readmission hospital costs (\$15 671.8 vs. \$14 286.4; P {$<$} 0.001) than the same-hospital readmission group. CONCLUSIONS Patient, hospital and market characteristics predicted different-hospital readmissions compared with same-hospital readmissions. Mortality and cost outcomes were worse among patients with different-hospital readmissions. Strategies for better care coordination targeting people at risk for different-hospital readmissions are necessary.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the public perceptions of the incidence rates and survival rates for common cancers with the actual rates from epidemiologic data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a survey of Korean adults without history of cancer (n=2,000). The survey consisted of questions about their perceptions regarding lifetime incidence rates and 5-year survival rates for total cancer, as well as those of eight site-specific cancers. To investigate associated factors, we included questions about cancer worry (Lerman's Cancer Worry Scale) or cared for a family member or friend with cancer as a caregiver. RESULTS: Only 19\% of Korean adults had an accurate perception of incidence rates compared with the epidemiologic data on total cancer. For specific cancers, most of the respondents overestimated the incidence rates and 10\%-30\% of men and 6\%-18\% of women had an accurate perception. A high score in "cancer worry" was associated with higher estimates of incidence rates in total and specific cancers. In cancers with high actual 5-year survival rates (e.g., breast and thyroid), the majority of respondents underestimated survival rates. However, about 50\% of respondents overestimated survival rates in cancers with low actual survival rates (e.g., lung and liver). There was no factor consistently associated with perceived survival rates. CONCLUSION: Widespread discrepancies were observed between perceived probability and actual epidemiological data. In order to reduce cancer worry and to increase health literacy, communication and patient education on appropriate risk is needed.},

The survival without major morbidities rate for 25-26  weeks' gestation infants was significantly higher in group 1 (31.2\%) than in  group 2 (18.5\%). Antenatal steroid use and Apgar score at 5\,min in group 1 were  associated with decreased mortality and survival without major morbidities in  23-24 and 25-26 weeks' gestation infants, respectively. In the multivariate  analyses, decreased mortality rates in 23-24 weeks' gestation infants were  associated with higher survival without major morbidities rates in 25-26 weeks'  gestation infants due to decreased bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular  leukomalacia, and late-onset sepsis. Evidence-based perinatal and neonatal  practices, including antenatal steroid use and better delivery room care  contributing to decreased mortality in periviable 23-24 weeks' gestation infants,  were associated with lower morbidity and higher survival without major  morbidities in more mature 25-26 weeks' gestation infants.},

  abstract = {The problem of ``variable selection'' is a fundamental one across the sciences. In its broadest terms, this problem would be at least part of the general issue of theory selection and comparison. However, there is a more circumscribed problem that concerns primarily the choice of variables for the best fitting model, given some set of data, usually observational in nature, and specific statistical techniques, typically multiple regression. There is a deep strand in econometrics and other applied social, behavioral, and biomedical science statistics to want formal decision rules or algorithms to pick out variables. The paper examines seven such formal procedures using a simulated data set with known causal relations. The conclusion is that seven often-used procedures make systematic causal errors. Some suggestions about better alternatives conclude.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Measures of socioeconomic disadvantage may enable improved targeting of programs to prevent rehospitalizations, but obtaining such information directly from patients can be difficult. Measures of U.S. neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage are more readily available but are rarely used clinically. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage at the census block group level, as measured by the Singh validated area deprivation index (ADI), and 30-day rehospitalization. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING United States. PATIENTS Random 5\% national sample of Medicare patients discharged with congestive heart failure, pneumonia, or myocardial infarction between 2004 and 2009 (n = 255,744). MEASUREMENTS Medicare data were linked to 2000 census data to construct an ADI for each patient's census block group, which were then sorted into percentiles by increasing ADI. Relationships between neighborhood ADI grouping and 30-day rehospitalization were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models, controlling for patient sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions and severity, and index hospital characteristics. RESULTS The 30-day rehospitalization rate did not vary significantly across the least disadvantaged 85\% of neighborhoods, which had an average rehospitalization rate of 21\%. However, within the most disadvantaged 15\% of neighborhoods, rehospitalization rates increased from 22\% to 27\% with worsening ADI. This relationship persisted after full adjustment, with the most disadvantaged neighborhoods having a rehospitalization risk (adjusted risk ratio, 1.09 [95\% CI, 1.05 to 1.12]) similar to that of chronic pulmonary disease (adjusted risk ratio, 1.06 [CI, 1.04 to 1.08]) and greater than that of uncomplicated diabetes (adjusted risk ratio, 0.95 [CI, 0.94 to 0.97]). LIMITATION No direct markers of care quality or access. CONCLUSION Residence within a disadvantaged U.S. neighborhood is a rehospitalization predictor of magnitude similar to chronic pulmonary disease. Measures of neighborhood disadvantage, such as the ADI, could potentially be used to inform policy and care after hospital discharge.

Methods A cross sectional retrospective study of adult medical patients readmitted to hospital within 28 days of discharge. Medical and nursing records were reviewed and patients and their carers were interviewed regarding their views about their discharge and readmission. Data were collected regarding demographic, social and medical profiles. Results Seventy-seven patients were readmitted over a five-week period out of 1289 patients discharged during the previous five weeks, representing a 6\% readmission rate. Mean (SD) age of readmitted patients was 71.3 (14.6) years. Forty patients (51.9\%) were aged =75 and 39 (50.6\%) were males. Mean (SD) number of comorbidities was 3.68 (1.82). Mean (SD) number of medications was 7.79 (4.14). Most common reasons for readmission were exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute coronary syndrome. Mean (SD) time to readmission was 11.6 (8.2) days. Fifty (64.9\%) patients were readmitted within 14 days of discharge. Forty eight (62.3\%) patients were readmitted with the same medical condition as their previous discharge. Fifty (64.9\%) patients and 45 (66.2\%) carers felt that discharge was appropriate. Forty five (58.0\%) patients and 44 (57.0\%) carers thought that readmission was unavoidable. Clinicians considered 56 (72.7\%) discharges appropriate and 55 (71.5\%) readmissions unavoidable. A trend towards higher readmission rate among patients = 75 years was noted (7.2\% vs 5.1\%, p=0.1). Conclusion Although the majority of discharges are appropriate, up to a third of readmissions may be avoidable in the views of carers, patients and clinicians. Patients and carers should be consulted regarding readiness for discharge before leaving hospital.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Inappropriate prescribing is an important and possibly preventable risk factor for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the elderly, and hospital-based studies have shown that a large proportion of admissions is a result of ADRs. However, little is known about how inappropriate drug use (IDU) affects the elderly at the population level. The aim of this study was to explore possible associations of IDU with acute hospitalisation and mortality in an elderly population during 3 years of follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from a rural, population-based, longitudinal cohort study within the Kungsholmen Project, Sweden, were used. 785 participants, {$>$} or=75 years of age, had complete data on drug use and selected covariates collected during baseline investigation from 1995 to 1998, and were included in the study. Hospitalisation and mortality data during 3 years after inclusion were collected. IDU was assessed at baseline using consensus-based criteria applicable to available data (derived from Beers' criteria, Canadian criteria and clinical indicators of drug-related morbidity in older adults) with the addition of potentially dangerous drug duplication and additional potentially hazardous drug-drug interactions. IDU was defined as presence of at least one inappropriate drug regimen according to the study criteria. Logistic regression and proportional hazard models were used, respectively, to study the association of IDU with hospitalisation and mortality. RESULTS: Drugs were used on a regular or 'as needed' basis by 91.6\% of the study population, with a mean of 4.4 drugs per person. IDU was common, with a prevalence of 18.6\% and was associated with increased risk of at least one acute hospitalisation in community-living elderly, after adjustment for age, sex, education, comorbidity, dependency in activities of daily living (ADL) and smoking. The odds ratio was 2.72 (95\% CI 1.64, 4.51). No association with mortality was found, after adjustment for age, sex, housing, education, comorbidity, ADL-dependency, smoking and body mass index. CONCLUSION: Polypharmacy and IDU are common among the elderly and IDU is associated with acute hospitalisation in community-living elderly. Although causality cannot be established with this study design, the results are consistent with the high prevalence of drug-related hospital admissions found in hospital-based studies. Our results indicate that it is desirable with current knowledge, to reduce IDU through information to physicians and careful prescribing.},

METHODS: ELSA is a population-based study of English adults aged {$>$}/= 50 years. Health literacy, participation in the national CRC screening programme, and covariates were interview-assessed in 2010-11. All those age-eligible for screening from 2006 to 11 were included in the present analysis (n=3087). The association between health literacy and screening was estimated using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS: 73\% of participants had adequate health literacy skills. Screening uptake was 58\% among those with adequate and 48\% among those with limited health literacy skills. Having adequate health literacy was associated with greater odds of CRC screening (multivariable adjusted OR=1.20; 95\% CI: 1.00-1.44), independent of other predictors of screening: age (OR=0.92; 95\% CI: 0.91-0.94 per one year increase), female sex (OR=1.31; 95\% CI: 1.11-1.54), and being in a higher wealth quintile (OR=1.88; 95\% CI: 1.43-2.49). CONCLUSIONS: Limited health literacy is a barrier to participation in England's national, publicly available CRC screening programme. Interventions should include appropriate design of information materials, provision of alternative support, and increased one-on-one interaction with health care professionals.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low health literacy is common among aging patients and is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality. We aimed to describe health literacy decline during aging and to investigate the roles of cognitive function and decline in determining health literacy decline. METHODS: Data were from 5,256 non-cognitively impaired adults aged {$>$}/= 52 years in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Health literacy was assessed using a four-item reading comprehension assessment of a fictitious medicine label, and cognitive function was assessed in a battery administered in-person at baseline (2004-2005) and at follow-up (2010-2011). RESULTS: Overall, 19.6\% (1,032/5,256) of participants declined in health literacy score over the follow-up. Among adults aged {$>$}/= 80 years at baseline, this proportion was 38.2\% (102/267), compared to 14.8\% (78/526) among adults aged 52-54 years (OR = 3.21; 95\% CI: 2.26-4.57). Other sociodemographic predictors of health literacy decline were: male sex (OR = 1.20; 95\% CI: 1.04-1.38), non-white ethnicity (OR = 2.42; 95\% CI: 1.51-3.89), low educational attainment (OR = 1.58; 95\% CI: 1.29-1.95 for no qualifications vs. degree education), and low occupational class (OR = 1.67; 95\% CI: 1.39-2.01 for routine vs. managerial occupations). Higher baseline cognitive function scores protected against health literacy decline, while cognitive decline (yes vs. no) predicted decline in health literacy score (OR = 1.59; 95\% CI: 1.35-1.87 for memory decline and OR = 1.56; 95\% CI: 1.32-1.85 for executive function decline). CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy decline appeared to increase with age, and was associated with even subtle cognitive decline in older non-impaired adults. Striking social inequalities were evident, whereby men and those from minority and deprived backgrounds were particularly vulnerable to literacy decline. Health practitioners must be able to recognize limited health literacy to ensure that clinical demands match the literacy skills of diverse patients.},

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between health literacy and participation in weekly MVPA over an 8-year period among older adults. METHODS: Data were from interviews with 4,345 adults aged 52-79 years in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing from 2004/2005 to 2012/2013, analyzed in 2015.

METHOD: The Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases were searched. Eligible studies were conducted in any country or language, included participants aged {$>$}/=50 years, presented a measure of association between age and health literacy, and were published through September 2013. RESULTS: Seventy analyses in 60 studies were included in the systematic review; 29 of these were included in the meta-analysis. Older age was strongly associated with limited health literacy in analyses that measured health literacy as reading comprehension, reasoning, and numeracy skills (random-effects odds ratio [OR] = 4.20; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 3.13-5.64). By contrast, older age was weakly associated with limited health literacy in studies that measured health literacy as medical vocabulary (random-effects OR = 1.19; 95\% CI: 1.03-1.37). Evidence on the mediating role of cognitive function was limited. DISCUSSION: Health literacy tests that utilize a range of fluid cognitive abilities and mirror everyday health tasks frequently observe skill limitations among older adults. Vocabulary-based health literacy skills appear more stable with age. Researchers should select measurement tests wisely when assessing health literacy of older adults.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low health literacy is associated with factors such as not taking medication as prescribed as well as poor health status and increased hospitalization and mortality risk, and has been identified as a risk factor for decreased physical function in older individuals. Health literacy is becoming an increasingly important issue because of the increased number of people affected by cancer who must make complicated treatment decisions. Health literacy has been shown to be positively associated with quality of life (QOL), and social support has been identified as important for addressing health-related problems and reducing the relative risk of mortality in patients with cancer. However, few studies have examined the relationship between health literacy, social support, age, and QOL. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the effects of health literacy, social support, and age on the QOL of patients with cancer. METHODS: An anonymous, self-administered online questionnaire was conducted from March 28 to 30, 2017, in Japan on patients with lung, stomach, or colon cancer that were voluntarily registered with an internet survey company. The survey covered basic attributes, health literacy, social support, and QOL. The European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire, a comprehensive measure of health literacy instrument, was used to measure health literacy; the Japanese version of the Social Support Scale was used to measure social support; and the Japanese version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (7-item version) assessment tool was used to measure QOL. RESULTS: A total of 735 survey invitations were randomly sent to patients with lung, stomach, or colorectal cancer, and responses were obtained from 619 (82.2\% response rate). Significant effects on the QOL in patients with lung, stomach, or colon cancer were observed for health literacy, social support, and age, and for the interactions of health literacy and social support and of social support and age. Health literacy, social support, and the interaction between these variables also showed a significant effect on the QOL in patients 50 years or older, but not on those younger than 50 years. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study revealed that higher health literacy, social support, and age were associated with the QOL in patients with cancer. In addition, the relationship with QOL was stronger for social support than for health literacy. These findings suggest the importance of health literacy and social support and indicate that social support has a greater effect on QOL than does health literacy, while the QOL in patients with cancer aged younger than 50 years was lower than that of those 50 years or older. Therefore, elucidating the needs of these patients and strengthening social support based on those needs may improve their QOL.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Owing to detrimental hazards and substantial healthcare burden and costs, hospitalisation of older people has become a major focus. Frailty has increasingly been recognised as an important predictor of hospitalisation. This study aims to identify studies on physical frailty as a predictor of hospitalisation risks and to pool the risk estimates among community-dwelling older people. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in August 2015 using five databases: EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library for prospective studies examining physical frailty as a predictor of hospitalisation published in 2000 or later. OR and HR were combined to synthesise pooled effect measures using fixed-effects models. The included studies were assessed for heterogeneity, methodological quality and publication bias. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis were conducted to examine study characteristics in relation to the hospitalisation risks. RESULTS: Of the 4620 studies identified by the systematic review, 13 studies with average follow-up period of 3.1 years were selected. Frailty and prefrailty were significantly associated with higher hospitalisation risks among 10 studies with OR (pooled OR=1.90, 95\% CI 1.74-2.07, p{$<$}0.00001; pooled OR=1.26, 95\% CI 1.18-1.33, p{$<$}0.00001, respectively) and 3 studies with HR (pooled HR=1.30, 95\% CI 1.12-1.52, p=0.0007; pooled HR=1.13, 95\% CI 1.04-1.24, p=0.005, respectively). Heterogeneity was low to moderate. No publication bias was detected. The studies with older populations and unadjusted outcome measures were associated with higher hospitalisation risks in the subgroup analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated physical frailty is a significant predictor of hospitalisation among community-dwelling older people. Hospitalisation can potentially be reduced by treating or preventing frailty.},

This article is based on work by advanced practice nurses in a nursing study funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research of the National Institute of Health. Mary Naylor, RN, PhD at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing through grant \#1RO1-NR04315 is using a transitional care model to provide advance practice nurse intervention for older adults with heart failure in a randomized controlled trial. Effects of the intervention being addressed include quality of life, functional status, rehospitalizations, and costs of care. Working with the patient in the acute hospital setting and following patients to the home care setting for 3 months, the advance practice nurse develops a visit pattern and intervention plan individual to the patient's needs. Key to a successful intervention plan is the right treatment for systolic versus diastolic failure. Although the patient's symptoms and some physical findings may be similar, the drugs used to treat systolic versus diastolic heart failure are different. Thus the nursing interventions to promote symptom management and avoid rehospitalizations have a different approach. In this article, care of elderly individuals with systolic versus diastolic heart failure is compared and contrasted using physical examination and diagnostic techniques, medication management, and nursing intervention. Case studies of a typical patient with systolic and diastolic heart failure will be used to illustrate the differences in approach to this common group of patients with complex needs.},

This study explored nurses'  experiences in preventing and managing neonatal sepsis in the Tamale metropolis.  METHODS: An exploratory, descriptive qualitative cross-sectional study design was  used, and data was collected using semi-structured interviews. The sample size  was determined at the point of data saturation of fifteen participants. Thematic  analysis was employed to identify codes, subthemes, and themes within the  interview transcripts. RESULTS: Three major challenges nurses face in preventing  and managing neonatal sepsis, including (1) the absence of a protocol for  handling newborns upon admission, (2) an excessive workload that made it  difficult for staff to follow infection prevention protocols, and (3) inadequate,  obsolete and/or lack of equipment that caused devices to be overused. The nurses  also identified critical psychological and emotional difficulties they encounter  as a result of working within such a stressful environment. Other activities  nurses conducted were handwashing before and after every procedure, infection  prevention, and separating the babies in the incubator. In managing babies with  neonatal sepsis, nurses provided daily treatment, hygiene care, and supported  activities of living. The nurses also assert that the availability of resources,  appropriate staff, and critical skills are important for preventing and managing  neonatal sepsis. CONCLUSION: The lack of basic working consumables like gloves,  syringes, and needles, inadequate staff, and lack of defined protocol of care  were identified as critical challenges that hamper the care provided in neonatal  care units. Hospital authorities must focus attention on addressing the critical  challenges faced by neonatal care units. Also, measures should be instituted to  address the emotional and psychological concerns associated with nursing care.  Future research must consider the level of influence of each of the challenges  enumerated on nurses' overall health.},

However, no specific measurement approach has been proposed for old age. The aim of this study is to augment the existing HLS-EU-Q16 scale (16 items) by items sensitive to age-specific aspects of health literacy to ensure validity and reliability for use in old age. In a first step, the HLS-EU-Q16 was administered in a sample of 463 individuals aged 72\,-\,92\,years. Psychometric properties were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis and item-response-theory item fit statistics. Scale reliability was found to be poor in this population segment. In a second step, age-specific items were developed based on qualitative in-depth interviews with older persons. In a third step, we tested if the additional set of age-specific items was able to enhance a valid and reliable measurement of health literacy in a second sample of older adults (N\,=\,107, 49\,-\,91\,years). With the inclusion of an eight-item add-on, it was possible to measure health literacy in old and very old age with both high validity and satisfying precision (reliability\,=\,0.80). The study contributes to a population-specific measurement of health literacy.},

Two independent clinicians using the ICD-10 for depression and dementia, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), the Hamilton Depression rating scale 17-items and the Mini-Mental-State Examination (MMSE), interviewed each patient or control subject. One hundred forty-five persons of 65 years or more of age were included, 73 were depressed only, 36 depressed and demented; 36 persons were control subjects, 11 of these were demented. The inter-rater reliabilities were high or very high equalling perfect correlation. There was very high convergent validity between the screening tools and the severity scales; the shorter versions of the GDS (15-, 10- or four-item version) had lower though still almost perfect correlations. The criterion validity in the total population showed the CSDD as the better scale with sensitivity and specificity of 93\% and 97\% with a cut-off value of {$>$} or =6. The GDS versions had sensitivities and specificities ranging from 82\% to 90\% and 75\% to 94\% respectively with cut-off values {$>$} or =9, 4, 3 and 1. The CSDD retained its validity and specificity as a screening tool for depression in a population of demented, while the GDS versions all diminished in validity.

METHOD: Two clinicians performed independent, blinded assessments of the study population, which was drawn from psychogeriatric outpatient clinics, and a control group of elderly subjects. Concurrent and convergent validity were assessed using correlation coefficient analyses, and to evaluate the internal validity, item response analysis using the Mokken coefficient and Rasch analysis was performed. A coefficient of homogeneity of 0.40 or higher indicated scalability. Data collection took place between October 2001 and April 2004. RESULTS: 145 subjects were included; 102 were female (mean age = 78.6 +/-6.8 years), and 43 were male (mean age = 72.4 +/-5.6 years). In the study group (N = 109), 73 subjects had depression only, and 36 had both depression and dementia; in the control group (N = 36), 11 subjects had dementia. The item-response analysis made a clear distinction between the scales. The HAM-D(6) was the only scale that fulfilled the criterion of total scalability in both the cognitively intact and the impaired populations. In terms of standardization according to the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S), the HAM-D(6) had the most convincing external validity overall. In terms of general correlation to the CGI-S, only small differences were shown between the scales. CONCLUSION: The HAM-D(6) should be separately considered even when longer HAM-D versions are used for the measurement of depression in elderly persons.},

Participants were tracked for 180 days after discharge. Data analyses were conducted between October 1, 2018, and May 30, 2019.County of residence was classified as urban or rural using the US Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban Continuum Codes. Rural counties were divided into those adjacent and not adjacent to urban counties.Primary outcomes were discharge to community vs a formal postacute care setting (ie, skilled nursing facility, home health care, or inpatient rehabilitation facility) and readmission and mortality within 30, 90, and 180 days of hospital discharge.Among 2\,044\,231 hospitalizations from 2011 to 2015, 1\,538\,888 (75.2\%; mean [SD] age, 80.4 [8.3] years; 866\,540 [56.3\%] women) were among patients from urban counties, 322\,360 (15.8\%; mean [SD] age, 79.6 [8.1] years; 175\,806 [54.5\%] women) were among patients from urban-adjacent rural counties, and 182\,983 (9.0\%; mean [SD] age, 79.8 [8.1] years; 98\,775 [54.0\%] women) were among patients from urban-nonadjacent rural counties.

However, compared with patients from urban counties, patients from the most rural counties were more frequently discharged to a skilled nursing facility (adjusted difference, 3.5 [95\% CI, 2.8-4.3] percentage points), while discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation facility was less common among patients from rural counties than among those from urban counties (urban vs urban-adjacent rural: adjusted difference, --1.9 [95\% CI, --2.4 to --1.4] percentage points; urban vs urban-nonadjacent rural: adjusted difference, --1.8 [95\% CI, --2.4 to --1.2] percentage points) as was discharge to home health care (urban vs urban-adjacent rural: adjusted difference, --1.7 [95\% CI, --2.3 to --1.2] percentage points; urban vs urban-nonadjacent rural: adjusted difference, --2.4 [95\% CI, --3.0 to --1.8]). For patients from the most rural counties, adjusted 30-day readmission rates were 0.4 (95\% CI, 0.2-0.6) percentage points higher than those of patients from urban counties among those who were discharged to the community but 0.3 (95\% CI, --0.6 to --0.1) percentage points lower among patients receiving postacute care. Adjusted 30-day mortality rates were 0.4 (95\% CI, 0.3-0.5) percentage points higher for patients from the most rural counties discharged to the community and 2.0 (95\% CI, --1.7 to 2.3) percentage points higher among those receiving postacute care. Rural-urban differences in 90-day and 180-day outcomes were similar.These findings suggest that rates of discharge to the community and postacute care settings were similar among patients from rural and urban counties. Rural-urban differences in mortality following discharge were much larger for patients receiving postacute care compared with patients discharged to the community setting. Improving postacute care in rural areas may reduce rural-urban disparities in patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Health literacy (HL) is recognised as an important, modifiable factor in the self-management and health performance of elderly people. The aim of this preliminary study was to identify and analyse the level of health literacy among the elderly living in one of the eastern regions in Poland. The cross-sectional study was conducted among a convenience sample of 200 seniors aged 65+ after cognitive pre-screening with the use of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale. To collect data, the Polish version of the HLS-EU-Q47 was used. More than half of the elderly surveyed presented problematic levels of general HL (GEN-HL), and also problematic levels of other dimensions: health care health literacy (HC-HL), disease prevention health literacy (DP-HL), and health promotion health literacy (HP-HL). The level of seniors' HL is dependent on the level of their education, place of living, participation in activities run by Daily Center for the Elderly, and their self-assessment of health condition (p {$<$} 0.05). These results imply the important message that there is a need to create initiatives and programs improving health literacy targeted at seniors living in rural areas, those with lower levels of education, and those with poor access to activities organised by institutions supporting seniors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, various tools exist to evaluate knowledge and awareness of antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and are applied by various organizations. Previous systematic reviews have focused mainly on study findings such as levels of knowledge and AMR awareness. However, the survey procedures and data instruments used ought to be scrutinized as well, since they are important contributors to credible results. This review aims to assess the study methods and procedures of existing population-based surveys and explore key components which determine the general population's levels of knowledge and awareness of antibiotic use and AMR. METHODS: We searched existing literature for population -based surveys which sought knowledge and awareness of antibiotic use or AMR in the general population. Databases searched included Ovid, MEDLINE and EMBASE, PsycINFO and Scopus, domestic journals and gray literature sources. Population-based cross-sectional studies published in English or Thai from January 2000 to December 2018 were included in the review. Quality assessment was conducted using the 'Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies' (AXIS). RESULTS: All 22 studies included in the analysis had clear objectives focusing on assessing people's levels of knowledge, awareness, attitudes and behavior relating to antibiotic use and awareness of AMR. These studies had employed appropriate methodologies for population-based cross-sectional surveys relative to research questions. More than half of studies (14 out of 22) had scientifically soundly designed methodologies which captured the representativeness of the population; whereas the remaining studies had unclear sample size estimations, inappropriate sample frames and selection biases. Half of the studies had tested the validity and reliability of the questionnaire. The common questions used by these surveys were categorized into four themes: behavior related to antibiotic use, knowledge and awareness of antibiotic use, knowledge and awareness of AMR and others such as receiving information about antibiotic use and AMR or cross-cutting issues like self-medication. CONCLUSION: This review identified four key features of good practices in antibiotic use and awareness surveys: a) clear survey objective; b) scientifically sound sampling techniques ensuring representativeness; c) strategies for recruitment of samples and survey administration methods; and d) credible measurement to prevent non-sampling biases. During questionnaire design, the health systems context in terms of access to health services and antibiotics should be taken into account. In conclusion, to maximize the use of surveys, the application of findings in surveys and associated factors related to antibiotic use and AMR should primarily generate public health interventions and target specific groups to make progress in solving AMR problems.},

The objective of this study was to explore the factors associated with health literacy in MHWs and MHVs in Thailand. A self-administered questionnaire was conducted from December 2018 to April 2019 in two migrant-populated provinces. A total of 40 MHWs, 78 MHVs, and 116 general migrants were included in the survey. Results showed that a higher education level was associated with a greater health literacy score. MHWs were more likely to have a higher health literacy score (5.59 points difference) than general migrants. The province per se and type of affiliations did not significantly contribute to the difference in the health literacy score of each individual. Most MHWs received health information from health professionals, health staff, and the internet, while MHVs and general migrants received information from health professionals, MHWs/MHVs, family/friends, and posters/leaflets. This study suggests that a higher education level should be used as a criterion for recruitment of MHWs and MHVs. Access to interactive health information like health professionals should be promoted as the main source of information to ensure better health literacy among MHWs and MHVs.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine if early unplanned readmissions of patients hospitalized for heart failure are associated with suboptimal in-hospital care or with the clinical and demographic characteristics of the patient. SUBJECT AND METHODS: We performed a case-control study among patients discharged with a principal diagnosis of heart failure. Cases included all patients unexpectedly readmitted within 31 days of discharge; controls were randomly selected from among those not readmitted. Quality of care was measured using explicit criteria reflecting the admission work-up, evaluation and treatment, and readiness for discharge. RESULTS: Ninety-one cases and 351 controls were included. There was no significant association between early unplanned readmissions and the scores for quality of the admission work-up or evaluation and treatment during the stay. There was a significant association between readiness for discharge and subsequent early readmission: for each 10\% decrease in the proportion of fulfilled criteria, the odds of readmission increased by 14\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1. 01 to 1.28, P = 0.04) for all-cause readmissions and by 19\% (95\% CI: 1.04 to 1.36, P = 0.01) for heart-failure-related readmissions. In a multiple logistic regression model, previous diagnosis of heart failure (odds ratio [OR] = 2.9, 95\% CI: 1.7 to 4.8, P {$<$}0.001), age (OR = 3.3, 95\% CI: 1.3 to 8.5, P = 0.01 for patients aged 65 to 79 years and OR = 4.1, 95\% CI: 1.6 to 11, P = 0.004 for patients aged 80 years and older), and history of cardiac revascularization (OR = 2.1, 95\% CI: 1.2 to 3.9, P = 0.01) showed a stronger association with early unplanned all-cause readmissions than the readiness-for-discharge score (OR = 1.16, 95\% CI: 1.02 to 1.31, P = 0.02). Similar findings were seen for heart failure-related readmissions. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with heart failure, early unplanned readmissions were not associated with suboptimal admission work-up or evaluation and treatment but were weakly associated with readiness for discharge. However, they were strongly associated with the patients' clinical and demographic characteristics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hypertension is the most important treatable risk factor for cardiovascular outcomes. Many patients with CKD are elderly, but the ideal BP in these individuals is unknown. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, \& MEASUREMENTS: From among 339,887 patients with incident eGFR{$<$}60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), we examined associations of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) with all-cause mortality, incident coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic strokes, and ESRD from the time of developing CKD until the end of follow-up (July 26, 2013, for mortality, CHD, and stroke, and December 31, 2011, for ESRD) in multivariable-adjusted survival models categorized by patients' age. RESULTS: Of the total cohort, 300,424 (88\%) had complete data for multivariable analysis. Both SBP and DBP showed a U-shaped association with mortality. SBP displayed a linear association with CHD, stroke, and ESRD, whereas DBP showed no consistent association with either. SBP{$>$}140 mmHg was associated with higher incidence of all examined outcomes, but with an incremental attenuation of the observed risk in older compared with younger patients (P{$<$}0.05 for interaction) The adjusted hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals associated with SBP{$\geq$}170 mmHg (compared with 130-139 mmHg) in patients {$<$}50, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and {$\geq$}80 years were 1.95 (1.34 to 2.84), 2.01 (1.75 to 2.30), 1.68 (1.49 to 1.89), 1.39 (1.25 to 1.54), and 1.30 (1.17 to 1.44), respectively. The risk of incident CHD, stroke, and ESRD was incrementally higher with higher SBP in patients aged {$<$}80 years but showed no consistent association in those aged {$\geq$}80 years (P{$<$}0.05 for interaction for all outcomes). CONCLUSIONS: In veterans with incident CKD, SBP showed different associations in older versus younger patients. The association of higher SBP with adverse outcomes was present but markedly reduced in older individuals, especially in those aged {$\geq$}80 years. Elevated DBP showed no consistent association with vascular outcomes in patients with incident CKD.},

Clarifying such terms is the essential first step. We define risk and a risk factor (protective factor) and their potency, set out the conceptual basis of the methods by which risk factors are identified and potency demonstrated, and propose criteria for establishing the status of a risk factor as a fixed or variable marker or a causal risk factor. All definitions are based on the state of scientific knowledge (empirical documentation), rather than on hypotheses, speculations, or beliefs. We discuss common approaches and pitfalls and give a psychiatric research example. Imprecise reports can impede the search for understanding the cause and course of any disease and also may be a basis of inadequate clinical or policy decision-making. The issues in risk research are much too important to tolerate less than precise terminology or the less than rigorous research reporting that results from imprecise and inconsistent terminology.}

The review expands on the key messages from a symposium held in Copenhagen in May 2017 and highlights avenues for future research. A narrative review of the symposium presentations and related literature is given. GDM is associated with increased short- and long-term adverse outcomes including Type 2 diabetes for both mother and offspring. Interestingly, GDM in mothers also predicts diabetes in the fathers. Thus, although GDM is diagnosed in pregnant women, the implications seem to affect the whole family. Structured lifestyle intervention can prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes. In this review, we show how numerous challenges are present in the target group, when such interventions are sought and implemented in real-world settings. Although interlinked and interacting, barriers to maintaining a healthy lifestyle post-partum can be grouped into those pertaining to diabetes beliefs, the family context and the healthcare system. Health literacy level and perceptions of health and disease risk may modify these barriers. There is a need to identify effective approaches to health promotion and health service delivery for women with prior GDM and their families. Future efforts may benefit from involving the target group in the development and execution of such initiatives as one way of ensuring that approaches are tailored to the needs of individual women and their families.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients' ability to manage medications is critical to chronic disease control. Also known as medication management capacity (MMC), it includes the ability to correctly identify medications and describe how they should be taken. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of low literacy, medication regimen complexity, and sociodemographic characteristics on MMC. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of enrollment data from participants in a randomized trial. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with coronary heart disease in an inner-city clinic. MEASUREMENTS: Medication management capacity was measured with the Drug Regimen Unassisted Grading Scale (DRUGS), which scores subjects' ability to identify, open, describe the dose, and describe the timing of their medications. DRUGS overall and component scores were compared by literacy, Mini Mental State Exam score, regimen complexity (number of prescription medications), and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Most of the 152 participants were elderly (mean age 65.4 years), women (54.6\%), and African American (94.1\%). Approximately half (50.7\%) had inadequate literacy skills, and 28.9\% had marginal skills. In univariate analysis, MMC was significantly associated with literacy (P{$<$}.001), and this effect was driven by the ability to identify medications. In multivariable models, patients with inadequate literacy skills had 10 to 18 times the odds of being unable to identify all of their medications, compared with those with adequate literacy skills (P{$<$}.05). CONCLUSIONS: Adults with inadequate literacy skills have less ability to identify their medications. Techniques are needed to better educate low-literacy patients about their medications, as a potential strategy to enhance adherence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Overall, poor physician-patient communication is related to post-discharge adverse events and readmission. We analyzed patients' ratings of the quality of physician-patient communication during hospitalization and how this varies by health literacy. METHODS: Medical patients were interviewed during their hospitalization to assess personal characteristics and health literacy. After discharge, patients completed by telephone the 27-item Interpersonal Processes of Care in Diverse Populations Questionnaire (IPC). Using the IPC, patients rated the clarity and quality of physicians' communication during the hospitalization along the following 8 domains: General clarity, Responsiveness to patient concerns, Explanation of patients' problems, Explanation of processes of care, Explanation of self-care after discharge, Empowerment, Decision making, and Consideration of patients' desire and ability to comply with recommendations. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients completed both the in-hospital and telephone interviews. Subjects had a mean age of 55, and 44\% had inadequate health literacy. Overall, patients gave the poorest ratings to communication that related to Consideration of patients' desire and ability to comply with recommendations. Patients with inadequate health literacy gave significantly worse ratings on the domains of General clarity, Responsiveness to patient concerns, and Explanation of processes of care (P {$<$} 0.05 for each). In multivariable analyses, the relationship with General clarity did not persist. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians received relatively poor ratings on their Consideration of patients' desire and ability to comply with recommendations. Patients with inadequate health literacy experienced lower quality and clarity of hospital communication along multiple domains. More attention to effective health communication is warranted in the hospital setting.},

  abstract = {New financial penalties for institutions with high readmission rates have intensified efforts to reduce rehospitalization. Several interventions that involve multiple components (e.g., patient needs assessment, medication reconciliation, patient education, arranging timely outpatient appointments, and providing telephone follow-up) have successfully reduced readmission rates for patients discharged to home. The effect of interventions on readmission rates is related to the number of components implemented; single-component interventions are unlikely to reduce readmissions significantly. For patients discharged to postacute care facilities, multicomponent interventions have reduced readmissions through enhanced communication, medication safety, advanced care planning, and enhanced training to manage medical conditions that commonly precipitate readmission. To help hospitals direct resources and services to patients with greater likelihood of readmission, risk-stratification methods are available. Future work should better define the roles of home-based services, information technology, mental health care, caregiver support, community partnerships, and new transitional care personnel.},

This paper reviews readmission policies in Denmark, England, Germany and the United States (Medicare system). The suggested roadmap enables researchers and policy makers to systematically compare and analyse readmission policies. We find considerable differences across countries. In Germany, the readmission policy aims to avoid unintended consequences of the introduction of DRG-based payment; it focuses on readmissions of individual patients and hospitals receive only one DRG-based payment for both the initial and the re-admission. In Denmark, England and the US readmission policies aim at quality improvement and focus on readmission rates. In Denmark, readmission rates are publicly reported but payments are not adjusted in relation to readmissions. In England and the US, financial incentives penalise hospitals with readmission rates above a certain benchmark. In England, this benchmark is defined through local clinical review, while it is based on the risk-adjusted national average in the US. At present, not enough evidence exists to give recommendations on the optimal design of readmission policies. The roadmap can be a tool for systematically assessing how elements of other countries' readmission policies can potentially be adopted to improve national policies.},

We provide patterns of hospital performance, based on these measures.                                                          Methods and Results---                              We calculated the 30-day mortality and readmission rates for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries ages 65 years or older with a primary diagnosis of AMI or HF, discharged between July 2005 and June 2008. We compared weighted risk-standardized mortality and readmission rates across Hospital Referral Regions and hospital structural characteristics. The median 30-day mortality rate was 16.6\% for AMI (range, 10.9\% to 24.9\%; 25th to 75th percentile, 15.8\% to 17.4\%; 10th to 90th percentile, 14.7\% to 18.4\%) and 11.1\% for HF (range, 6.6\% to 19.8\%; 25th to 75th percentile, 10.3\% to 12.0\%; 10th to 90th percentile, 9.4\% to 13.1\%). The median 30-day readmission rate was 19.9\% for AMI (range, 15.3\% to 29.4\%; 25th to 75th percentile, 19.5\% to 20.4\%; 10th to 90th percentile, 18.8\% to 21.1\%) and 24.4\% for HF (range, 15.9\% to 34.4\%; 25th to 75th percentile, 23.4\% to 25.6\%; 10th to 90th percentile, 22.3\% to 27.0\%). We observed geographic differences in performance across the country. Although there were some differences in average performance by hospital characteristics, there were high and low hospital performers among all types of hospitals.                                                          Conclusions---                              In a recent 3-year period, 30-day risk-standardized mortality rates for AMI and HF varied among hospitals and across the country. The readmission rates were particularly high.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND To isolate hospital effects on risk-standardized hospital-readmission rates, we examined readmission outcomes among patients who had multiple admissions for a similar diagnosis at more than one hospital within a given year. METHODS We divided the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services hospital-wide readmission measure cohort from July 2014 through June 2015 into two random samples. All the patients in the cohort were Medicare recipients who were at least 65 years of age. We used the first sample to calculate the risk-standardized readmission rate within 30 days for each hospital, and we classified hospitals into performance quartiles, with a lower readmission rate indicating better performance (performance-classification sample). The study sample (identified from the second sample) included patients who had two admissions for similar diagnoses at different hospitals that occurred more than 1 month and less than 1 year apart, and we compared the observed readmission rates among patients who had been admitted to hospitals in different performance quartiles. RESULTS In the performance-classification sample, the median risk-standardized readmission rate was 15.5\% (interquartile range, 15.3 to 15.8). The study sample included 37,508 patients who had two admissions for similar diagnoses at a total of 4272 different hospitals. The observed readmission rate was consistently higher among patients admitted to hospitals in a worse-performing quartile than among those admitted to hospitals in a better-performing quartile, but the only significant difference was observed when the patients were admitted to hospitals in which one was in the best-performing quartile and the other was in the worst-performing quartile (absolute difference in readmission rate, 2.0 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval, 0.4 to 3.5; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS When the same patients were admitted with similar diagnoses to hospitals in the best-performing quartile as compared with the worst-performing quartile of hospital readmission performance, there was a significant difference in rates of readmission within 30 days. The findings suggest that hospital quality contributes in part to readmission rates independent of factors involving patients.

There is a global acceptance that health and social wellbeing are determined by many factors outside the health system which include socioeconomic conditions, patterns of consumption associated with food and communication, demographic patterns, learning environments, family patterns, the cultural and social fabric of societies; sociopolitical and economic changes, including commercialization and trade and global environmental change. In such a situation, health issues can be effectively addressed by adopting a holistic approach by empowering individuals and communities to take action for their health, fostering leadership for public health, promoting intersectoral action to build healthy public policies in all sectors and creating sustainable health systems. Although, not a new concept, health promotion received an impetus following Alma Ata declaration. Recently it has evolved through a series of international conferences, with the first conference in Canada producing the famous Ottawa charter. Efforts at promoting health encompassing actions at individual and community levels, health system strengthening and multi sectoral partnership can be directed at specific health conditions. It should also include settings-based approach to promote health in specific settings such as schools, hospitals, workplaces, residential areas etc. Health promotion needs to be built into all the policies and if utilized efficiently will lead to positive health outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite significant global progress in reducing neonatal mortality, bacterial sepsis remains a major cause of neonatal deaths. Klebsiella pneumoniae  (K. pneumoniae) is the leading pathogen globally underlying cases of neonatal  sepsis and is frequently resistant to antibiotic treatment regimens recommended  by the World Health Organization (WHO), including first-line therapy with  ampicillin and gentamicin, second-line therapy with amikacin and ceftazidime, and  meropenem. Maternal vaccination to prevent neonatal infection could reduce the  burden of K. pneumoniae neonatal sepsis in low- and middle-income countries  (LMICs), but the potential impact of vaccination remains poorly quantified. We  estimated the potential impact of such vaccination on cases and deaths of K.  pneumoniae neonatal sepsis and project the global effects of routine immunization  of pregnant women with the K. pneumoniae vaccine as antimicrobial resistance  (AMR) increases. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a Bayesian mixture-modeling  framework to estimate the effects of a hypothetical K. pneumoniae maternal  vaccine with 70\% efficacy administered with coverage equivalent to that of the  maternal tetanus vaccine on neonatal sepsis infections and mortality. To  parameterize our model, we used data from 3 global studies of neonatal sepsis  and/or mortality-with 2,330 neonates who died with sepsis surveilled from 2016 to  2020 undertaken in 18 mainly LMICs across all WHO regions (Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali,  Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Uganda, Brazil, Italy,  Greece, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, China, and Vietnam). Within these  studies, 26.95\% of fatal neonatal sepsis cases were culture-positive for K.  pneumoniae. We analyzed 9,070 K. pneumoniae genomes from human isolates gathered  globally from 2001 to 2020 to quantify the temporal rate of acquisition of AMR  genes in K. pneumoniae isolates to predict the future number of drug-resistant  cases and deaths that could be averted by vaccination. Resistance rates to  carbapenems are increasing most rapidly and 22.43\% [95th percentile Bayesian  credible interval (CrI): 5.24 to 41.42] of neonatal sepsis deaths are caused by  meropenem-resistant K. pneumoniae. Globally, we estimate that maternal  vaccination could avert 80,258 [CrI: 18,084 to 189,040] neonatal deaths and  399,015 [CrI: 334,523 to 485,442] neonatal sepsis cases yearly worldwide,  accounting for more than 3.40\% [CrI: 0.75 to 8.01] of all neonatal deaths. The  largest relative benefits are in Africa (Sierra Leone, Mali, Niger) and  South-East Asia (Bangladesh) where vaccination could avert over 6\% of all  neonatal deaths. Nevertheless, our modeling only considers country-level trends  in K. pneumoniae neonatal sepsis deaths and is unable to consider within-country  variability in bacterial prevalence that may impact the projected burden of  sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: A K. pneumoniae maternal vaccine could have widespread,  sustained global benefits as AMR in K. pneumoniae continues to increase.},

SUBJECTS: 1,204 consecutive hospital medical patients aged 70 years and over in Hong Kong. PROCEDURES: Subjects were interviewed by a research nurse on discharge, and were followed up for six months. OUTCOME: Unplanned hospital readmissions were identified and classified as avoidable or unavoidable. The risk factors for early (within 28 days), recurrent (three or more) and avoidable readmissions were studied by multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Four hundred and fifty-five patients (37.7\%) had at least one readmission in six months; 18\%, 6.4\%, and 2.9\% of subjects had early, recurrent and avoidable readmissions respectively. Recent hospital stay predicted all types of readmissions. Early readmission was predicted by length of stay, Barthel index (assessment of physical and mental function) and unresolved medical problems. Recurrence readmission was predicted by poor family support, residence in a home for the elderly and unresolved medical problems. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital readmission may be prevented by ensuring adequate length of stay, so that medical problems are resolved before discharge.},

METHODS: A decomposition method was used to examine the factors that account for the change of total hospitalisation days during the two periods, 2001-2004 and 2004-2012. The five factors include two demographic factors - population size and age-gender composition - and three service components - hospital discharge rate, number of discharge episodes per patient, and average length of stay (LOS) - which are all measured at age-gender group level. In order to assess the health cost burden in the future, we also project the total hospitalisation days up to 2041, for a range of scenarios. RESULTS: During the decreasing period of hospitalisation days (2001-2004), the reduction of LOS contributed to about 60\% of the reduction. For the period of increase (2004-2012), ageing is associated with an increase in total hospitalisation days of 1.03 million, followed by an increase in hospital discharge rates (0.67 million), an increase in the number of discharge episodes per patient (0.62 million), and population growth (0.43 million). The reduction of LOS has greatly offset these increases (-2.19 million days), and has become one of the most significant factors in containing the increasing number of hospitalisation days. Projected increases in total hospitalisation days under different scenarios have highlighted that the contribution of ageing will become even more prominent after 2022. CONCLUSION: Hong Kong is facing increasing healthcare burden caused by the rapid increase in demand for inpatient services due to ageing. Better management of inpatient services with the aim of increasing efficiency and reducing LOS, avoidable hospitalisation and readmission, without compromising patient satisfaction and quality of service, are crucial for containing the rapid and enormous increases in total hospitalisation days for Hong Kong. The results would be relevant to many rapidly ageing societies in this region.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the most common modality of revascularization in patients with coronary artery disease. Understanding the readmission rates and reasons for readmission after PCI is important because readmissions are a quality of care indicator, in addition to being a burden to patients and healthcare services. METHODS: A literature review was performed. Relevant studies are described by narrative synthesis with the use of tables to summarize study results. RESULTS: Data suggests that 30-day readmissions are not uncommon. The rate of readmission after PCI is highly influenced by the cohort and the healthcare system studied, with 30-day readmission rates reported to be between 4.7-\% and 15.6\%. Studies consistently report that a majority of readmissions within 30days are due to a cardiac-related disorders or complication-related disorders. Female sex, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, renal failure and non-elective PCI are predictive of readmission. Studies also suggest that there is greater risk of mortality among patients who are readmitted compared to those who are not readmitted. CONCLUSION: Readmission after PCI is common and its rate is highly influenced by the type of cohort studied. There is clear evidence that majority of readmissions within 30days are cardiac related. While there are many predictors of readmission following PCI, it is not known whether targeting patients with modifiable predictors could prevent or reduce the rates of readmission.},

  abstract = {Existing equations for bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) are of limited use when subjects age or become overweight because these equations were developed in young, normal-weight subjects and are not valid in elderly or overweight people. The purpose of this study was to validate a single BIA equation in healthy white subjects aged 22--94 y with a body mass index between 17.0 and 33.8 kg/m(2). Healthy subjects (202 men and 141 women) aged 20--94 y were measured by two methods: fat-free mass (FFM) was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Hologic QDR-4500) and by a bioelectrical impedance analyzer (Xitron 4000B). Validity of BIA was assessed by double cross validation. Because correlations were high (r = 0.986--0.987) and prediction errors low, a single equation was developed using all subjects, as follows: FFM = -4.104 + (0.518 x height(2)/resistance) + (0.231 x weight) + (0.130 x reactance) + (4.229 x sex: men = 1, women = 0). FFM predicted with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was 54.0 +/- 10.7 kg. BIA-predicted FFM was 54.0 +/- 10.5 kg (r = 0.986, standard error of the estimate = 1.72 kg, technical error = 1.74 kg). In conclusion, the new Geneva BIA equation was valid for prediction of FFM in healthy adults aged 22--94 y with body mass indexes between 17.0 and 33.8 kg/m(2). Inclusion of reactance in the single prediction equation appeared to be essential for use of BIA equations in populations with large variations in age or body mass.},

Other challenges in caring for this patient population include dosing medications safely, preventing delirium and accidental falls, and providing adequate pain control. Ways to improve the care of the hospitalized elderly patient include the following: screening for geriatric syndromes such as delirium, assessing functional status and maintaining mobility, and implementation of interventions that have been shown to prevent delirium, accidental falls, and acute functional decline in the hospital.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of bloodstream infections (BSI) in neonates is usually difficult due to minimal symptoms at presentation; thus early empirical therapy  guided by local antibiotic susceptibility profile is necessary to improve  therapeutic outcomes. METHODS: A review of neonatal blood cultures submitted to  the microbiology department of the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital was conducted from  January 2010 through December 2013. We assessed the prevalence of bacteria and  fungi involved in BSI and the susceptibility coverage of recommended empiric  antibiotics by Ghana Standard Treatment guidelines and the WHO recommendations  for managing neonatal sepsis. The national and WHO treatment guidelines recommend  either ampicillin plus gentamicin or ampicillin plus cefotaxime for empiric  treatment of neonatal BSI. The WHO recommendations also include cloxacillin plus  gentamicin. We described the resistance profile over a 28-day neonatal period  using multivariable logistic regression analysis with linear or restricted cubic  splines. RESULTS: A total of 8,025 neonatal blood culture reports were reviewed  over the four-year period. Total blood culture positivity was 21.9~\%. Gram  positive organisms accounted for most positive cultures, with coagulase negative  staphylococci (CoNS) being the most frequently isolated pathogen in early onset  infections (EOS) (59.1~\%) and late onset infections (LOS) (52.8~\%).  Susceptibility coverage of early onset bacterial isolates were 20.7~\% to  ampicillin plus cefotaxime, 32.2~\% to the combination of ampicillin and  gentamicin, and 71.7~\% to cloxacillin plus gentamicin. For LOS, coverage was  24.6~\% to ampicillin plus cefotaxime, 36.2~\% to the combination ampicillin and  gentamicin and 63.6~\% to cloxacillin plus gentamicin. Cloxacillin plus gentamicin  remained the most active regimen for EOS and LOS after exclusion of BSI caused by  CoNS. For this regimen, the adjusted odds of resistance decreased between 12-34~\%  per day from birth to day 3 followed by the slowest rate of resistance increase,  compared to the other antibiotic regimen, thereafter until day 28. The trend in  resistance remained generally unchanged after excluding data from CoNS. Multidrug  resistant isolates were significantly (p-value {$<$}0.001) higher in LOS (62.4~\%,  n\,=\,555/886) than in EOS (37.3~\%, n\,=\,331/886). CONCLUSIONS: There is low  antibiotic susceptibility coverage for organisms causing neonatal bloodstream  infections in Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital when the current national and WHO  recommended empiric antibiotics were assessed. A continuous surveillance of  neonatal BSI is required to guide hospital and national antibiotic treatment  guidelines for neonatal sepsis.},

  abstract = {Antisepsis that uses running water and an aqueous solution is usually referred to as a "scrub". Scrubs are commonly used by surgical staff for hand antisepsis during pre-surgical preparation, and contain agents, such as chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone iodine. Scrubbing involves wetting the hands and forearms with water, systematically applying the scrub solution using hands or sponges and rinsing under running water. This process typically takes up to six minutes. The term "rub" usually refers to hand antisepsis procedures and products that do not require running water. The most commonly used rub products contain at least 60\% alcohol (v/v). Alcohol-based rubs have a well-established role in infection control strategy in healthcare settings for routine hand sanitization,(1-4) including hospitals, outpatient clinics, laboratory settings, community settings and for hand sanitization in surgical contexts.(5-8) The ubiquitous usage of alcohol-based rubs is based on evidence for reduced infectious transmission, low cost, and their high acceptability and tolerability relative to other methods of sanitization.(9,10) Nevertheless, there have been some concerns associated with the usage of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, such as religious objections, abuse potential, and flammability.(3) These concerns, combined with a desire to optimize infection control and user acceptability, has led to the development of several non-alcohol based hand rub products. These products use antimicrobial agents such as triclosan, chlorhexidine, iodophors or quaternary ammonium compounds; various combinations and formulations have been developed (e.g., water-based, foams, gels, nanocapsules).(11,12) The purpose of this report is to review the evidence regarding the effectiveness of non-alcohol based hand sanitizer (rubs) for reducing infection rates and infection transmission in the healthcare setting for both healthcare workers and non-healthcare personnel. Another objective of this report is to summarize evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of non-alcohol based hand rubs.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS               A race-stratified random sample of 6,317 adults with type 2 or type 1 diabetes, aged 60 to 75 years, enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California, who completed a survey that included a HRQL instrument based on the Short Form 8-item health survey. Administrative records were used to ascertain diagnoses of geriatric syndromes, diabetes complications, and hypoglycemia. Associations were estimated between HRQL and exposures in exposure-specific and combined exposure models (any syndrome, any complication, or hypoglycemia). Conservatively, differences of {$\geq$}3 points were considered the minimally important difference in HRQL scores.                                         RESULTS               HRQL was lower with nearly all exposures of interest. The lowest physical HRQL was associated with amputation. In combined exposure models, geriatric syndromes (-5.3 [95\% CI -5.8 to -4.8], P \&lt; 0.001) and diabetes complications (-3.5 [-4.0 to -2.9], P \&lt; 0.001) were associated with lower physical HRQL. The lowest mental HRQL was associated with depression, underweight (BMI \&lt;18 kg/m2), amputation, and hypoglycemia. In combined exposure models, only hypoglycemia was associated with lower mental HRQL (-4.0 [-7.0 to -1.1], P = 0.008).                                         CONCLUSIONS               Geriatric syndromes and hypoglycemia are associated with lower HRQL to a comparable degree as diabetes complications. Addressing geriatric syndromes and avoiding hypoglycemia should be given as high a priority as preventing diabetes complications in older adults with diabetes.},

DESIGN: Open, randomised, controlled pilot treatment study. SETTING: Community-based research centre. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-six community-dwelling frail elderly people aged 75 and older, 40\% men. INTERVENTION: Four treatment arms: i) individual nutritional advice and group sessions on nutrition for the elderly, ii) physical training 2 x 45 minutes per week for 3 months, iii) combined nutritional and physical intervention and iv) control group. MEASUREMENTS: The outcomes were energy intake (4-day food diary); resting metabolic rate (indirect calorimetry) and body composition (anthropometry) performed at baseline, after 3 months' intervention (completed by 79 individuals), and as a follow-up at 9 months (completed by 64 individuals). RESULTS: The training group showed a significantly increased RMR at 3 months. Otherwise, there were no observed differences within or between the four groups. There was no correlation over time between energy intake, RMR and fat free mass. The participants with a low energy intake who managed to increase their energy intake during the study ('responders') had a statistically significantly lower BMI (21 vs. 24) and a lower fat percentage (23 vs. 30) at baseline than the 'non-responders'. The 'non-responders' showed a small but statistically significant decrease in body fat percentage at F1, and in body weight, BMI and FFM at 9 months (F3). CONCLUSION: Individual nutrition counselling and physical exercise had no effect on energy intake, RMR or fat free mass in community-dwelling frail elderly people aged 75 and older. Interventions in frail elderly people should be targeted according to the needs of the individual patients. The issues of randomisation, targeting and responders in are problematised and discussed.},

An explorative study using focus groups was carried out aiming at identifying the carers' views and experiences for a needs-based conceptualisation of the information and counselling in discharge planning. The results indicate when, according to the interviewees, information and counselling should be offered and the importance of trust within the consultation process which should reach beyond the hospital setting. In addition to illness- and care-related aspects as well as organisational and administrative issues, carers also expressed needs for support in emotional coping, problem solving, relief of burden and peer support in everyday life. Integrating carers in the conceptualisation of discharge planning will help to develop needs-based information and counselling services.},

During the period from 2002 through 2004, a group of Italian hospitals was recruited to conduct HAI point-prevalence surveys. DESIGN: Three point-prevalence surveys. METHODS: A total of 9,609 patients were surveyed. RESULTS: The overall frequency of HAI was 6.7\% (645 infections among the 9,609 surveyed patients). The most frequent HAIs were lower respiratory tract infections, which accounted for 35.8\% (231 of 645 HAIs) of all HAIs, followed by urinary tract infections (152 [23.6\%] of 645 HAIs), bloodstream infections (90 [14.0\%] of 645 HAIs), and surgical site infections (79 [12.2\%] of 645 HAIs). In both multivariate and univariate analysis, invasive procedures, duration of stay, chemotherapy, trauma, coma, and the location of the hospital were all factors statistically significantly associated with the occurrence of an HAI. Enterobacteriaceae were the most common isolates recovered in medical and surgical wards, whereas gram-negative aerobic bacilli were the most common isolates recovered in intensive care units. Approximately one-half of all of the patients surveyed were receiving antibiotics at the time of our study; the most used antibiotic classes were fluoroquinolones in medical wards, cephalosporins in surgical wards, and penicillins and glycopeptides in intensive care units.

  abstract = {AIMS: To determine the contributing factors in the successful diabetes education of patients and their entourage. METHODS: Prospective observational study conducted in a pre-hospital setting by 17 emergency services across France (September 2009-January 2011) included all insulin-treated patients ({$\geq$}18~years) provided that at least one family member was present on scene. Data were collected from patients and their entourage: (1) personal details including language proficiency and educational attainment, (2) treatments, (3) diabetes-related data (log sheets, glucose meter, glucagon, glycated hemoglobin, prior hypoglycemic episodes); (4) care by diabetologist, general practitioner and/or visiting nurse. The main end points were ability to measure capillary blood sugar (patient) and awareness of hypoglycemia symptoms and ability to administer glucagon (entourage). RESULTS: Overall, 561 patients and 736 family members were included; 343 patients (61\%) were experiencing a hypoglycemic episode ({$<$}2.5~mmol/L). A total of 141 (75\%) patients and 343 (50\%) family members could measure capillary blood sugar. They could name a median of 2 [0-3‰] hypoglycemia symptoms although 217 (39\%) patients and 262 (39\%) family members could name no symptom. Few patients (33\%) had glucagon available. In multivariate analyses, the main factor associated with better patient education was care by a diabetologist. Lack of an educational qualification and visits by a nurse were associated with poor patient education, and French mother tongue and care by a diabetologist with better education of the entourage. CONCLUSIONS: In France, diabetic patients and their entourage are inadequately educated. Their education benefits most from care by a diabetologist.},

Having performed both a phenomenographic and a phenomenological analysis of the same transcripts, the researchers compared the results from the two approaches. The result of the phenomenographic study was four ways of understanding work: (a) monitoring and controlling the patient's vital functions; (b) guiding the patient safely through the operation; (c) serving patients, other doctors and nurses; (d) leading the operating theatre and team. The phenomenological analysis showed the essence of being an anaesthesiologist: Carrying the responsibility for the patient's vital functions; always being alert, watching carefully over the patient's body, ready to act whenever the patient's life is in danger, however difficult the circumstances.

In a sample of 2,042 patients, multivariable models demonstrated that lower health literacy and younger age were significantly associated with a lower likelihood of completing research follow-up interviews at 2-3 days, 30 days, and 90 days after hospital discharge. In addition, patients who had less education, were currently employed, and had moderate financial stress were less likely to complete 90-day follow-up.

  abstract = {Amid increased concerns about the adverse consequences of low health literacy, it remains unclear how health literacy affects health status and health service utilization. Moreover, studies have shown significant variation in individual adaptation to health literacy problems. This article proposes research hypotheses to address two questions: (1) What are the causal pathways or intermediate steps that link low health literacy to poor health status and high utilization of expensive services such as hospitalization and emergency care? (2) What impact does social support have on the relationships between health literacy and health service utilization? Empirical studies of health literacy are reviewed to indicate the limitations of current literature and to highlight the importance of the proposed research agenda. In particular, we note the individualistic premise of current literature in which individuals are treated as isolated and passive actors. Thus, low health literacy is considered simply as an individual trait independent of support and resources in an individual's social environment. To remedy this, research needs to take into account social support that people can draw on when problems arise due to their health literacy limitations. Examination of the proposed agenda will make two main contributions. First, we will gain a better understanding of the causal effects of health literacy and identify missing links in the delivery of care for patients with low health literacy. Second, if social support buffers the adverse effects of low health literacy, more effective interventions can be designed to address differences in individuals' social support system in addition to individual differences in reading and comprehension. More targeted and more cost-efficient efforts could also be taken to identify and reach those who not only have low health literacy but also lack the resources and support to bridge the unmet literacy demands of their health conditions.},

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the influence of frailty status and BMI category on mortality in older adults. METHODS: Data were from the Living Profiles of Older People Survey, a national survey of community-dwelling older people in Korea, with a baseline study of 11,844 Koreans aged 65 years and older in 2008 and a 3-year follow-up for mortality. Frailty was categorized as not frail, prefrail, and frail, based on five indicators (weight loss, exhaustion, physical activity, walking speed, and grip strength). BMI (kg/m(2)) was classified as underweight ({$<$}18.5), normal (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9), or obese ({$>$}/=30.0). A Cox proportional model was used to analyze the association of the combined frailty and BMI categories with all-cause mortality, adjusting for sociodemographics and health-related factors. RESULTS: Adjusting for covariates, compared with the normal-weight nonfrail counterpart, the underweight or normal-weight prefrail/frail status demonstrated significantly increased rates of death. The obese frail respondents showed a significantly higher mortality risk (hazard ratio, 3.89; 95\% confidence interval, 1.14-13.28). The overweight prefrail/frail group, however, exhibited no significant association with mortality. CONCLUSION: Among older people who were of normal weight or underweight, greater frailty was associated with poorer survival. Whereas being overweight tended to be neutral of the influence of frailty on mortality, the obese frail exhibited a significantly elevated rate of death.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recent evidence supports a link between caregivers' health literacy and their children's health and use of health services. Disruptions in children's health insurance coverage have been linked to poor health care and outcomes. We examined young children's Medicaid enrollment patterns in a well-characterized cohort of child/caregivers dyads and investigated the association of caregivers' low health literacy with the incidence of enrollment gaps. METHODS: We relied upon Medicaid enrollment data for 1208 children (mean age{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}19 months) enrolled in the Carolina Oral Health Literacy project during 2008-09. The median follow-up was 25 months. Health literacy was measured using the Newest Vital Sign (NVS). Analyses relied on descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate methods based on Poisson modeling. FINDINGS: One-third of children experienced one or more enrollment gaps; most were short in duration (median{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}5 months). The risk of gaps was inversely associated with caregivers' age, with a 2\% relative risk decrease for each added year. Low health literacy was associated with a modestly elevated risk increase [Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR){$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.17 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-1.57)] for enrollment disruptions; however, this estimate was substantially elevated among caregivers with less than a high school education [IRR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.52 (95\% CI 0.99-2.35); homogeneity p{$<$}0.2]. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide initial support for a possible role of caregivers' health literacy as a determinant of children's Medicaid enrollment gaps. Although the association between health literacy and enrollment gaps was not confirmed statistically, we found that it was markedly stronger among caregivers with low educational attainment. This population, as well as young caregivers, may be the most vulnerable to the negative effects of low health literacy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The burden of non-communicable disease (NCDs) has grown rapidly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where populations are ageing, with rising prevalence of multimorbidity (more than two co-existing chronic conditions) that will significantly increase pressure on already stretched health systems. We assess the impact of NCD multimorbidity on healthcare utilisation and out-of-pocket expenditures in six middle-income countries: China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa. METHODS: Secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from adult participants ({$>$}18 years) in the WHO Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) 2007-2010. We used multiple logistic regression to determine socio-demographic correlates of multimorbidity. Association between the number of NCDs and healthcare utilisation as well as out-of-pocket spending was assessed using logistic, negative binominal and log-linear models. RESULTS: The prevalence of multimorbidity in the adult population varied from 3.9\% in Ghana to 33.6\% in Russia. Number of visits to doctors in primary and secondary care rose substantially for persons with increasing numbers of co-existing NCDs. Multimorbidity was associated with more outpatient visits in China (coefficient for number of NCD = 0.56, 95\% CI = 0.46, 0.66), a higher likelihood of being hospitalised in India (AOR = 1.59, 95\% CI = 1.45, 1.75), higher out-of-pocket expenditures for outpatient visits in India and China, and higher expenditures for hospital visits in Russia. Medicines constituted the largest proportion of out-of-pocket expenditures in persons with multimorbidity (88.3\% for outpatient, 55.9\% for inpatient visit in China) in most countries. CONCLUSION: Multimorbidity is associated with higher levels of healthcare utilisation and greater financial burden for individuals in middle-income countries. Our study supports the WHO call for universal health insurance and health service coverage in LMICs, particularly for vulnerable groups such as the elderly with multimorbidity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To validate a hypothesized model exploring the influencing pathways of empowerment perceptions, health literacy, self-efficacy, and self-care behaviors to glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). METHODS: Overall, 295 patients with T2DM were recruited from five endocrine clinics in Taiwan through convenience sampling. Data regarding personal characteristics, empowerment perceptions, health literacy, self-efficacy, self-care behaviors, and HbA1c levels were collected. A structural equation modeling was used to validate the hypothesized model. RESULTS: Significant direct pathways were determined from empowerment perceptions to health literacy, from health literacy to self-efficacy, from self-efficacy to self-care behaviors, and from self-care behaviors to HbA1c levels. CONCLUSIONS: The empowerment perceptions and health literacy relatively influenced self-efficacy and self-care behaviors. Self-efficacy and self-care behaviors relatively influenced glycemic control in patients with T2DM. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Modifying self-care behaviors have been demonstrated to be the most essential for improving glycemic control. To improve self-care behaviors, healthcare providers should target improving self-efficacy, and enhancing health literacy can be considered to be a potential strategy for improving self-efficacy. To enhance health literacy, healthcare providers could use an empowerment approach rather than an authoritative approach that emphasizes patient compliance in managing patients with T2DM.},

  abstract = {Background: The internet has emerged as a main venue of health information delivery and health-related activities. However, few studies have examined how health literacy determines online health-related behavior. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the current level of health-related information-seeking using the internet and how health literacy, access to technology, and sociodemographic characteristics impact health-related information-seeking behavior. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study through a survey with Minnesotan adults (N=614) to examine their health literacy, access to technology, and health-related information-seeking internet use. We used multivariate regression analysis to assess the relationship between health-related information-seeking on the internet and health literacy and access to technology, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Better health literacy ({$\beta$}=.35, SE 0.12) and greater access to technological devices (eg, mobile phone and computer or tablet PC; {$\beta$}=.06, SE 0.19) were both associated with more health-related information-seeking behavior on the internet after adjusting for all other sociodemographic characteristics. Possession of a graduate degree ({$\beta$}=.28, SE 0.07), female gender ({$\beta$}=.15, SE 0.05), poor health ({$\beta$}=.22, SE 0.06), participation in social groups ({$\beta$}=.13, SE 0.05), and having an annual health exam ({$\beta$}=.35, SE 0.12) were all associated with online health-related information-seeking. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that access to online health-related information is not uniformly distributed throughout the population, which may exacerbate disparities in health and health care. Research, policy, and practice attention are needed to address the disparities in access to health information as well as to ensure the quality of the information and improve health literacy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Polypharmacy has been linked to a myriad of adverse consequences, and escalating rates of polypharmacy present an emerging concern, particularly among older adults. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the existing literature concerning the association between polypharmacy and mortality. DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature review was done by searching the EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, and International Pharmaceutical Abstract databases to identify studies assessing the association between polypharmacy and death published until June~2016. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that investigated the association between polypharmacy and mortality were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by the first and second authors independently using a data extraction form. Disagreement was resolved by consensus. A meta-analysis was performed using random effect models. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies were included in this meta-analysis. The underlying populations were heterogeneous (I(2)= 91.5\%). When defined as a discrete variable, pooled risk estimates demonstrated a significant association between polypharmacy and death (pooled-adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.08 [95\% CI 1.04-1.12]). When defined categorically, a dose-response relationship was observed across escalating thresholds for defining polypharmacy. Categorical thresholds for polypharmacy using values of 1-4 medications, 5 medications, and 6-9 medications were significantly associated with death (P {$<$}0.05; aOR 1.24 [1.10-1.39], aOR 1.31 [1.17, 1.47], and aOR 1.59 [1.36-1.87], respectively). Excessive polypharmacy (ie, the use of 10 or more medications) was also associated with death (aOR 1.96 [1.42-2.71]). CONCLUSIONS: Pooled risk estimates from this meta-analysis reveal that polypharmacy is associated with increased mortality risk, using both discrete and categorical definitions. The causality of this relationship remains unclear, but it emphasizes the need for approaches to health care delivery that achieve an optimal balance of risk and benefit in medication prescribing.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to get a clear idea of the reading frequency of the patient information leaflet (PIL) and to set up a profile of the reader in specific. Apart from that, we also wanted to evaluate the impact of the internet in the patient's search for information on health and medication. Do patients consult the digital PIL and is the FAGG website known by common people? In order to answer these research questions, a specific inquiry was performed in 800 respondents. Some interesting conclusions can be drawn: only one out of four participants reads the full PIL when purchasing a medicine they never used before. People who always read the PIL are mainly older than 65. However, the largest amount of people who never reads the PIL is also situated in the plus 65 scale. In general, men show little interest in reading the PIL unlike woman, who read clearly more often the PIL. The parts of the PIL most often read by patients are the sections on dosage (section 3) and side effects (section 4). Unfortunately, too little attention is paid to the section 2, which contains the most warnings, such as contra-indications. The most important reason why the PIL is not read is because patients believe they get sufficient information from the doctor and the pharmacist. Another remark is that the internet is used by more than half of the respondents to search for health-related information. There is also a remarkable difference between men and woman, men rarely search for health information or information on medicines on the internet. The number of respondents searching for leaflets on the internet is quite limited. Additionally, the Federal Agency Medicines and Health Products (FAMHP) website is unknown to most internet users. We can conclude that the actual PIL is read too little. In order to make the PIL more appealing and even more patient friendly than it is actually, taking patients' needs into account should be a priority. The digital leaflet should be drawn attention to in order for patients to make more use of the information that is available to them.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sepsis is the 3rd leading cause of neonatal mortality in Ethiopia contributing to 16\% of neonatal death. In a hospital study, neonatal sepsis was  the leading diagnosis at admission and the second leading cause of neonatal death  at the neonatal intensive care unit. Among other factors repeated vaginal  examination during labor is known to contribute to sepsis in low-income settings.  However, there is limited evidence in the Ethiopian setting. OBJECTIVE: The  objective of this study was to examine the association between early-onset  neonatal sepsis and repeated vaginal examinations. METHODS: The study was  conducted at Gandhi Memorial Hospital, a public maternity and newborn care  hospital. We followed 672 mother-newborn pairs by phone until 7 days of age to  detect clinical sepsis. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 software.  Adjusted odds ratio risk (AOR) with a corresponding 95\% confidence interval (CI)  was used to show the strength of associations and variables with p-value\,{$<$}\,0.05  were considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: The incidence of  early-onset neonatal sepsis was found to be 20.83\% (95\% CI 17.60, 24.00). Having  a frequent vaginal examination (four or more times) during labor and delivery,  prolonged rupture of membranes, induced labor and gestational age\,{$<$}\,37 weeks were  strongly associated with the development of early-onset neonatal sepsis, (AOR 2.  69;95 CI: 1.08, 6.70) AOR 5.12(95\% CI 1.31, 20.00), AOR of 5.24 (95\% CI 1.72,  AOR4.34 (95\% CI 1.20, 15.68), 16.00), respectively. CONCLUSION: Frequent digital  vaginal examination prolonged rupture of membranes, induced labor and gestational  age\,{$<$}\,37 weeks significantly increases the risk of early onset neonatal sepsis.  We also recommend further study using neonatal blood culture to better diagnose  early onset neonatal sepsis objectively.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Health literacy (HL) has been associated with lower mortality in heart failure (HF). However, the results of previous studies may not be generalizable because the research was conducted in relatively young and highly-educated patients in United States settings. This study assessed the association of HL with disease knowledge, self-care, and all-cause mortality among very old patients, with a very low educational level. METHODS: This prospective study was performed in 556 patients (mean age, 85 years), with high comorbidity, admitted for HF to the geriatric acute-care unit of 6 hospitals in Spain. About 74\% of patients had less than primary education and 71\% had preserved systolic function. Health literacy was assessed with the Short Assessment of Health Literacy for Spanish-speaking Adults questionnaire, knowledge of HF with the DeWalt questionnaire, and HF self-care with the European Heart Failure Self-Care Behaviour Scale. RESULTS: Disease knowledge progressively increased with HL; compared with being in the lowest (worse) tertile of HL, the multivariable beta coefficient (95\%CI) of the HF knowledge score was 0.60 (0.01-1.19) in the second tertile and 0.87 (0.24-1.50) in the highest tertile, P-trend = .008. However, no association was found between HL and HF self-care. During the 12 months of follow-up, there were 189 deaths. Compared with being in the lowest tertile of HL, the multivariable HR (95\%CI) of mortality was 0.84 (0.56-1.27) in the second tertile and 0.99 (0.65-1.51) in the highest tertile, P-trend = .969. CONCLUSIONS: No association was found between HL and 12-month mortality. This could be partly due to the lack of a link between HL and self-care.},

  abstract = {Importance: Reducing early ({$<$}30 days) hospital readmissions is a policy priority aimed at improving healthcare quality. The Cumulative Complexity Model conceptualizes patient context. It predicts that highly supportive discharge interventions will enhance patient capacity to enact burdensome self-care and avoid readmissions. Objectives: To synthesize the evidence of the efficacy of interventions to reduce early hospital readmissions and identify intervention features---including their impact on treatment burden and on patients' capacity to enact post-discharge self-care---that might explain their varying effects. Data Sources: We searched electronic databases (1990 until April 1st, 2013), contacted experts, and reviewed bibliographies. Study Selection: Randomized trials that assessed the effect of interventions on all-cause or unplanned readmissions within 30 days of discharge in adult patients admitted to the hospital for a medical or surgical cause for {$>$} 24 hours and discharged to home. Data extraction and Synthesis: Reviewer pairs extracted trial characteristics and used an activity-based coding strategy to characterize the interventions; fidelity was confirmed with authors. Blinded to trial outcomes, reviewers noted the extent to which interventions placed additional work on patients after discharge or supported their capacity for self-care in accordance with the Cumulative Complexity Model. Main Outcome: Relative risk of all-cause or unplanned readmission with or without out of hospital deaths at 30 days post-discharge. Results: In 42 trials, the tested interventions prevented early readmissions [pooled random effects relative risk (RR) 0.82, 95\% CI 0.73 to 0.91; p=.03; I2= 32\%], a finding that was consistent across patient subgroups. Trials published before 2002 reported interventions that were 1.6 times more effective than those tested later (pinteraction = .01). In exploratory subgroup analyses, interventions with many components (pinteraction {$<$}.01), involving more individuals in care delivery (pinteraction = .05), and supporting patient capacity for self-care (pinteraction = .04) were 1.4, 1.3, and 1.3 times more effective than other interventions. A post-hoc regression model showed incremental value in providing comprehensive, post-discharge support to patients and caregivers. Conclusions: Tested interventions are effective at reducing readmissions, but more effective interventions are complex and support patient capacity for self-care. Interventions tested more recently are less effective. Registration Number: PROSPERO, CRD42013004773},

Conclusions               Diabetes, particularly type 2, is becoming more prevalent in the general population, especially in individuals over the age of 65 years. The underlying pathophysiology of the disease in these patients is exacerbated by the direct effects of aging on metabolic regulation. Similarly, aging effects interact with diabetes to accelerate the progression of many common diabetes complications. Each section in this guideline covers all aspects of the etiology and available evidence, primarily from controlled trials, on therapeutic options and outcomes in this population. The goal is to give guidance to practicing health care providers that will benefit patients with diabetes (both type 1 and type 2), paying particular attention to avoiding unnecessary and/or harmful adverse effects.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Attendance at emergency departments and unplanned hospital readmissions are common for frail older patients after discharge from hospitals. A virtual ward service was piloted to deliver "hospital-at-home" services by community nurses and geriatricians to frail older patients immediately after their discharge from hospital to reduce emergency services utilization. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the impacts of the virtual ward service on changes in the patients' emergency attendance and medical readmissions, and their quality of life (QOL). METHODS: A matched-control quasi-experimental study was conducted at four hospitals, with three providing the virtual ward service (intervention) and one providing the usual community nursing care (control). Subjects in the intervention group were those who are at high risk of readmission and who are supported by home carers recruited from the three hospitals providing the virtual ward service. Matched control patients were those recruited from the hospital providing usual care. Outcome measures include emergency attendance and medical readmission in the past 90 days as identified from medical records, and patient-reported QOL as measured by the modified Quality-of-Life Concerns in the End of Life Questionnaire (Chinese version). Wilcoxon signed-rank tests compared the changes in the outcome variables between groups. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients in each of the two groups were recruited. The virtual ward group showed a greater significant reduction in the number of unplanned emergency hospital readmissions (-1.41{\textpm}1.23 versus -0.77{\textpm}1.31; P=0.049) and a significant improvement in their overall QOL (n=18; 0.60{\textpm}0.56 versus 0.07{\textpm}0.56; P=0.02), but there was no significant difference in the number of emergency attendances (-1.51{\textpm}1.25 versus -1.08{\textpm}1.48; P=0.29). CONCLUSION: The study results support the effectiveness of the virtual ward service in reducing unplanned emergency medical readmissions and in improving the QOL in frail older patients after discharge.},

The objective of this study was to assess health literacy and the relationship between health literacy and HF self-care in HF patient-caregiver dyads. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventeen patient-caregiver dyads were recruited. Dyads completed a measure of HF self-care and 2 measures of health literacy: 3 validated questions and a nutrition label reading task. Patients were older than caregivers and the majority of both patients and caregivers were female. Caregivers had higher health literacy by both the health literacy questions (P = .001) and label-reading measure (P = .001). All caregivers had adequate health literacy as assessed by the 3 questions, but 29\% had inadequate health literacy according to the label-reading task. Caregivers and patients scored adequately in HF maintenance but inadequately in management and confidence domains. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers had better health literacy than patients; however, the task-oriented label-reading measure revealed poorer health literacy than the self-report measure. Measures of health literacy that reflect day to day tasks may be more illuminating than the 3 questions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Among the requirements for meaningful use of electronic medical records (EMRs) is that patients must be able to interact online with information from their records. However, many older Americans may be unprepared to do this, particularly those with low levels of health literacy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to quantify the relationship between health literacy and use of the Internet for obtaining health information among Americans aged 65 and older. DESIGN: We performed retrospective analysis of 2009 and 2010 data from the Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative sample of older Americans. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and older (824 individuals in the general population and 1,584 Internet users). MAIN MEASURES: Our analysis included measures of regular use of the Internet for any purpose and use of the Internet to obtain health or medical information; health literacy was measured using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine-Revised (REALM-R) and self-reported confidence filling out medical forms. KEY RESULTS: Only 9.7\% of elderly individuals with low health literacy used the Internet to obtain health information, compared with 31.9\% of those with adequate health literacy. This gradient persisted after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, health status, and general cognitive ability. The gradient arose both because individuals with low health literacy were less likely to use the Internet at all (OR = 0.36 [95\% CI 0.24 to 0.54]) and because, among those who did use the Internet, individuals with low health literacy were less likely to use it to get health or medical information (OR = 0.60 [95\% CI 0.47 to 0.77]). CONCLUSION: Low health literacy is associated with significantly less use of the Internet for health information among Americans aged 65 and older. Web-based health interventions targeting older adults must address barriers to substantive use by individuals with low health literacy, or risk exacerbating the digital divide.},

This study analyzed a large, nationally representative sample of community-dwelling adults ages 50 and older to estimate the relationship between low health literacy and self-reported difficulty obtaining care. We found that individuals with low health literacy were significantly more likely than individuals with adequate health literacy to delay or forgo needed care or to report difficulty finding a provider, even after we controlled for other factors, including health insurance coverage, employment, race/ethnicity, poverty, and general cognitive function. They were also more likely to lack a usual source of care, although this result was only marginally significant after we controlled for other factors. The results show that in addition to any obstacles that low health literacy creates within the context of the clinical encounter, low health literacy also reduces the probability that people get in the door of the health care system in a timely way.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The age-specific relevance of blood pressure to cause-specific mortality is best assessed by collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from the separate prospective studies. METHODS: Information was obtained on each of one million adults with no previous vascular disease recorded at baseline in 61 prospective observational studies of blood pressure and mortality. During 12.7 million person-years at risk, there were about 56000 vascular deaths (12000 stroke, 34000 ischaemic heart disease [IHD], 10000 other vascular) and 66000 other deaths at ages 40-89 years. Meta-analyses, involving "time-dependent" correction for regression dilution, related mortality during each decade of age at death to the estimated usual blood pressure at the start of that decade. FINDINGS: Within each decade of age at death, the proportional difference in the risk of vascular death associated with a given absolute difference in usual blood pressure is about the same down to at least 115 mm Hg usual systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 75 mm Hg usual diastolic blood pressure (DBP), below which there is little evidence. At ages 40-69 years, each difference of 20 mm Hg usual SBP (or, approximately equivalently, 10 mm Hg usual DBP) is associated with more than a twofold difference in the stroke death rate, and with twofold differences in the death rates from IHD and from other vascular causes. All of these proportional differences in vascular mortality are about half as extreme at ages 80-89 years as at ages 40-49 years, but the annual absolute differences in risk are greater in old age. The age-specific associations are similar for men and women, and for cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral ischaemia. For predicting vascular mortality from a single blood pressure measurement, the average of SBP and DBP is slightly more informative than either alone, and pulse pressure is much less informative. INTERPRETATION: Throughout middle and old age, usual blood pressure is strongly and directly related to vascular (and overall) mortality, without any evidence of a threshold down to at least 115/75 mm Hg.},

  abstract = {Purpose We describe a method for testing and estimating a two-way additive interaction between two categorical variables, each of which has greater than or equal to two levels. Methods We test additive and multiplicative interactions in the same proportional hazards model and measure additivity by relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), proportion of disease attributable to interaction (AP), and synergy index (S). A simulation study was used to compare the performance of these measures of additivity. Data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort study with a total of 15,792 subjects were used to exemplify the methods. Results The test and measures of departure from additivity depend neither on follow-up time nor on the covariates. The simulation study indicates that RERI is the best choice of measures of additivity using a proportional hazards model. The examples indicated that an interaction between two variables can be statistically significant on additive measure (RERI = 1.14, p = 0.04) but not on multiplicative measure ({$\beta$}3 = 0.59, p = 0.12) and that additive and multiplicative interactions can be in opposite directions (RERI = 0.08, {$\beta$}3 = --0.08). Conclusions The method has broader application for any regression models with a rate as the dependent variable. In the case that both additive and multiplicative interactions are statistically significant and in the opposite direction, the interpretation needs caution.},

METHODS: For data collection, intentional sampling of 300 elders was used. The questionnaire was composed of 5 items based on "Ministry of Health, the People's Republic of China (2008)" to measure health literacy, 33 health status items from the "Korean Health Status Measure for Elderly People" developed by Shin (2002), revised for use in China, and 9 general characteristics. Data were analyzed using SPSS Win 13.0 program. RESULTS: Total level of health literacy was relatively high (68.7\%). Elders had high scores for taking medicines according to doctor's instruction, but lower ones for full comprehension through communication with doctors. Health status was high for emotional, physical, and social function in that order. There were significant differences between general characteristics and health status for gender, age, marital status, education, family, smoking, and alcohol consumption in that order. Results of multiple regression analysis for factors influencing health status showed that self-report health level was the most influential, followed by health literacy, age, gender. CONCLUSION: Health literacy is the main factor affecting health promotion among minority elders indicating a need to develop health promotion programs for elders who have low health literacy.},

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted using an administrative database at a general medicine service in a tertiary public hospital between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2011. Demographic and clinical factors, as well as readmission patterns, were evaluated for the association with 7- and 28-day readmission. RESULTS: The study cohort included 13 802 patients and the 28-day readmission rate was 10.9\%. In multivariate analysis, longer hospital stay of the index admission (adjusted relative risk (ARR) 1.34), Charlson index {$>$}/= 3 (ARR 1.28), discharge against medical advice (ARR 1.87), active malignancy (ARR 1.83), cardiac failure (ARR 1.48) and incomplete discharge summaries (ARR 1.61) were independently associated with increased risk of 28-day readmission. Patients with diseases of the respiratory system, neurological or genitourinary disease, injury and unclassifiable conditions were likely to be readmitted within 7 days. Patients with circulatory and respiratory disease were likely to be readmitted with the same system diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Readmission of general medicine patients within 28 days is relatively common and is associated with clinical factors and patterns. Identification of these risk factors and patterns will enable the interventions to reduce potentially preventable readmissions.},

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to construct a structural equation model to explore the relationship between health literacy, social support, and the care ability of dementia caregivers. It is hoped that the study will provide a theoretical basis for future intervention. We recruited 225 dementia patients and their caregivers from August 2018 to June 2019 at the Department of Geriatrics and Neurology. We issued a health literacy questionnaire, social support scale, and a care ability questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 19.0 and SPSS Amos 23.0. The mean scores for health literacy, social support, and care ability were 13.93{\textpm}4.18, 34.64{\textpm}6.42, and 44.44{\textpm}9.31, respectively. Health literacy was directly related to social support (path coefficient~=~0.454). Social support was directly related to care ability (path coefficient~=~0.293). Furthermore, health literacy was directly related to care ability (path coefficient~=~0.561), while health literacy had indirect associations with care ability via social support (path coefficient~=~0.133). This study showed that improving the health literacy of caregivers effectively improved their care ability, and that social support was important for the link between health literacy and care ability. Medical staff and family members can provide appropriate health education and social support according to the characteristics of caregivers to improve the care ability of caregivers, improve the quality of life of patients, and delay the disease process.},

  abstract = {Introduction A body shape index (ABSI) is independently associated with mortality in general population, but studies on the predictability of ABSI in the risk of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are limited. We aimed to examine the independent and joint association of ABSI, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and body roundness index (BRI) with mortality in patients with T2D. Research design and methods The study included 11 872 patients (46.5\% women) aged 30 years and older and who took part in diabetes care management program of a medical center in Taiwan. Body indices were evaluated by anthropometric measurements at baseline between 2001 and 2016, and their death status was followed up through 2021. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to assess the effect of body indices on mortality. Results During a mean follow-up of 10.2 years, 560 cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths and 3043 deaths were recorded. For ABSI, WC, WHR, WHtR and BRI, all-cause mortality rates were statistically significantly greater in Q4 versus Q2. For BMI and WHtR, all-cause mortality rates were also statistically significantly greater in Q1 versus Q2. The combination of BMI and ABSI exhibited a superiority in identifying risks of all-cause mortality and CVD mortality (HRs: 1.45 and 1.37, both p{$<$}0.01). Conclusions Combined use of ABSI and BMI can contribute to the significant explanation of the variation in death risk in comparison with the independent use of BMI or other indices.},

  abstract = {To provide an overview of the global, regional, and national incidence and mortality of neonatal sepsis and other neonatal infections (NS) and their change  trends from 1990 to 2019, based on the data from the 2019 Global Burden of  Disease study. This was a retrospective demographic analysis based on aggregated  data. Annual incident cases, deaths, age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR),  age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and their percentage changes of NS during  1990-2019 were collected from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study. Globally,  the incident cases of NS increased by 12.79\% (from 5.59 million in 1990 to 6.31  million in 2019), and the deaths decreased by 12.93\% (from 0.26 million in 1990  to 0.23 million in 2019). In the globe, the ASIR of NS per 100,000 population  increased by 14.35\% (from 85.21 in 1990 to 97.43 in 2019), and the ASMR decreased  by 11.91\% (from 3.97 in 1990 to 3.5 in 2019). CONCLUSION: Increasing trends in  incidence and decreasing trends in mortality of NS were observed worldwide from  1990 to 2019. More robust epidemiological research and effective health  strategies are urgently needed to reduce the disease burden of neonatal sepsis  worldwide. WHAT IS KNOWN: {$\bullet$} Neonatal sepsis has significant impacts on neonatal  health, but estimates on the global burden and trends of neonatal sepsis are  scarce and existing findings vary considerably. WHAT IS NEW: {$\bullet$} Globally, there  were 6.31 million incident cases of neonatal sepsis and 0.23 million deaths due  to neonatal sepsis. {$\bullet$} Increasing trends in incidence and decreasing trends in  mortality of neonatal sepsis were observed worldwide from 1990 to 2019, with the  highest absolute burden in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposes to use 30-day hospital readmissions after ischemic stroke as part of the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program for payment determination beginning in 2016. The proportion of poststroke readmissions that is potentially preventable is unknown. METHODS: Thirty-day readmissions for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged{$\geq$}65 years discharged alive with a primary diagnosis of ischemic stroke (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 433, 434, 436) between December 2005 and November 2006 were analyzed. Preventable readmissions were identified based on 14 Prevention Quality Indicators developed for use with administrative data by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. National, hospital-level, and regional preventable readmission rates were estimated. Random-effects logistic regression was also used to determine patient-level factors associated with preventable readmissions. RESULTS: Among 307 887 ischemic stroke discharges, 44 379 (14.4\%) were readmitted within 30 days; 5322 (1.7\% of all discharges) were the result of a preventable cause (eg, pneumonia), and 39 057 (12.7\%) were for other reasons (eg, cancer). In multivariate analysis, older age and cardiovascular-related comorbid conditions were strong predictors of preventable readmissions. Preventable readmission rates were highest in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and US territories and lowest in the Mountain and Pacific regions. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Prevention Quality Indicators, we found that a small proportion of readmissions after ischemic stroke were classified as preventable. Although other causes of readmissions not reflected in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality measures could also be avoidable, hospital-level programs intended to reduce all-cause readmissions and costs should target high-risk patients.},

DESIGN: Prospective multicentre, randomised controlled trial with six months of follow-up with blinded outcome measurement. SETTING: Four university-affiliated metropolitan general hospitals in Victoria. PARTICIPANTS: All patients aged 65 years and over who were discharged between August 1998 and October 1999 and required community services after discharge. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly allocated to receive services of a Post-Acute Care (PAC) coordinator (intervention) versus usual discharge planning (control). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of quality of life and carer stress at one-month post-discharge, mortality, hospital readmissions, use of community services and community and hospital costs over the six months post-discharge. RESULTS: 654 patients were randomised, and 598 were included in the analysis (311 in the PAC group and 287 in the control group). There was no difference in mortality between the groups (both 6\%), but significantly greater overall quality-of-life scores at one-month follow-up in the PAC group. There was no difference in unplanned readmissions, but PAC patients used significantly fewer hospital bed-days in the six months after discharge (mean, 3.0 days; 95\% CI, 2.1-3.9) than control patients (5.2 days; 95\% CI, 3.8-6.7). Total costs (including hospitalisation, community services and the intervention) were lower in the PAC than the control group (mean difference, \$1545; 95\% CI, \$11-\$3078). CONCLUSIONS: The PAC program is beneficial in the transition from hospital to the community in older patients.},

However, many commonly used terms, such as 'the war against superbugs', risk misleading people to request 'new' or 'stronger' antibiotics from their doctors, veterinary surgeons or pharmacists, rather than addressing a fundamental issue: the misuse and overuse of antibiotics in humans and animals. Simple measures of antibiotic consumption are needed for mass communication. In this article, we describe the concept of the 'antibiotic footprint' as a tool to communicate to the public the magnitude of antibiotic use in humans, animals and industry, and how it could support the reduction of overuse and misuse of antibiotics worldwide. We propose that people need to make appropriate changes in behaviour that reduce their direct and indirect consumption of antibiotics.},

  abstract = {Background For decades, antibiotics have been excessively consumed around the world, contributing to increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and negatively impacting health outcomes and expenditures. Antibiotic use in China accounts for half of worldwide antibiotic consumption, which mainly takes place in outpatient and community settings, and often unnecessarily for self-limiting community-acquired infections. This study aimed to identify and assess factors of inappropriate use of antibiotics in the Chinese context to inform the development of interventions to mitigate inappropriate consumption in the absence of clinical indications.Methods We conducted a mixed-methods systematic review and included empirical studies with original data conducted in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan that investigated factors of antibiotic use in the community including outpatient care among patients, caregivers and prescribers. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Google Scholar and one Chinese database CNKI (China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database), using a combination of the key terms `antibiotic', `antimicrobial', `use', `consumption', `behaviour', `prescribe' and related syntax for all peer-reviewed publications published before June 2020. Health Belief Model was employed for data synthesis.Findings Fifty-four studies were included in the full-text review: 44 quantitative, 5 qualitative and 5 mixed-methods studies. Despite a high AMR awareness, public perception/misconception of antibiotic efficacy and easy access to antibiotics for self-limiting conditions drive inappropriate demand and use in the community including primary care setting. Providers' prescribing behaviours are influenced by financial incentives, lack of diagnostic capacity and concerns over complications.Conclusions Inappropriate outpatient and community antibiotic use is influenced by non-biomedical factors at the individual, community, health system and societal levels in mainland China, contributing to a high antibiotic use rate. This study calls for context-tailored One Health interventions, restrictive antibiotic drug policy and multifaceted antibiotic stewardship programmes that simultaneously address drivers of inappropriate use from both the supply-side and demand-side within and beyond clinical settings.PROSPERO registration number CRD42019139591.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between income inequality and the risk of mortality and readmission within 30 days of hospitalization. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries in the United States. Hierarchical, logistic regression models were developed to estimate the association between income inequality (measured at the US state level) and a patient's risk of mortality and readmission, while sequentially controlling for patient, hospital, other state, and patient socioeconomic characteristics. We considered a 0.05 unit increase in the Gini coefficient as a measure of income inequality. SETTING: US acute care hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 65 years and older, and hospitalized in 2006-08 with a principal diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, or pneumonia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of death within 30 days of admission or rehospitalization for any cause within 30 days of discharge. The potential number of excess deaths and readmissions associated with higher levels of inequality in US states in the three highest quarters of income inequality were compared with corresponding data in US states in the lowest quarter. RESULTS: Mortality analyses included 555,962 admissions (4348 hospitals) for acute myocardial infarction, 1,092,285 (4484) for heart failure, and 1,146,414 (4520); readmission analyses included 553,037 (4262), 1,345,909 (4494), and 1,345,909 (4524) admissions, respectively. In 2006-08, income inequality in US states (as measured by the average Gini coefficient over three years) varied from 0.41 in Utah to 0.50 in New York. Multilevel models showed no significant association between income inequality and mortality within 30 days of admission for patients with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, or pneumonia. By contrast, income inequality was associated with rehospitalization (acute myocardial infarction, risk ratio 1.09 (95\% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.15), heart failure 1.07 (1.01 to 1.12), pneumonia 1.09 (1.03 to 1.15)). Further adjustment for individual income and educational achievement did not significantly attenuate these findings. Over the three year period, we estimate an excess of 7153 (2297 to 11,733) readmissions for acute myocardial infarction, 17,991 (3410 to 31,772) for heart failure, and 14,127 (4617 to 23,115) for pneumonia, that are associated with inequality levels in US states in the three highest quarters of income inequality, compared with US states in the lowest quarter. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia, exposure to higher levels of income inequality was associated with increased risk of readmission but not mortality. In view of the observational design of the study, these findings could be biased, owing to residual confounding.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many seniors rely on paid non-familial caregivers to maintain their independence at home. Caregivers often assist with medication reminding and activities of daily living. No prior studies have examined the health literacy levels among paid non-familial caregivers. OBJECTIVES: To determine health literacy levels and the health-related responsibilities of paid non-familial caregivers of seniors. DESIGN: One-on-one face-to-face surveys. The Test for Functional Health Literacy (TOFHLA) was administered to identify health literacy levels. Caregivers were asked to demonstrate their skill in medication use by following directions on pill bottles and sorting medications into pill boxes. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-eight paid unrelated caregivers of seniors recruited at physician offices, caregiver agencies, senior shopping areas, and independent living facilities. RESULTS: Average age of caregivers was 49.5 years, and 86.7\% were female. Inadequate health literacy was found in 35.7\% of caregivers; 60.2\% of all caregivers made errors with the pillbox test medications, showing difficulty in following label directions. Health-related tasks (i.e., medication reminding, sorting, dispensing, and accompanying seniors to physician appointments) were performed by 85.7\% of caregivers. The mean age of their seniors was 83.9 years (range 65-99 years), and 82.1\% were female. CONCLUSION: Paid non-familial caregivers are essential for many seniors to remain independent and maintain their health. Many caregivers perform health-related duties, but over 1/3 have inadequate health literacy and have difficulties following medication-related instructions. Educating caregivers and ascertaining their health literacy levels prior to assigning health-related tasks may be an important process in providing optimal care to seniors.},

METHODS: Persons with AD were provided with individually chosen AT during a six-month period. Semi-structured interviews were conducted during the intervention period. The data were analysed with a constant comparative approach. RESULTS: On the way towards becoming a user of AT, four junctures were identified, at which significant decisions were made by the participants. These decisions influenced whether to become a user or not and related to how the initial decision was made, how the routines to incorporate the AT were adjusted, whether the participant trusted the AT, and whether the participants felt an increased sense of capacity when using the AT. As users, the participants perceived how time and effort was saved, how worries and stress decreased, and how their sense of safety increased, which enabled them to perform valued activities, e.g. health-promoting and social activities, to a greater extent and in a more relaxed way than before. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the view that AT can positively affect the activity performance of people with AD when the potential user can identify difficulties and needs and is motivated and able to make changes to overcome them, given that appropriate human support is available.},

The risk of coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart disease, chronic kidney insufficiency and dementia is also increased in this subgroup of hypertensives. Hypertension in the elderly patients represents a management dilemma to cardiovascular specialists and other practioners. During the last years and before the findings of the Systolic Hypertension in Europe Trial were published, the general medical opinion considered not to decrease blood pressure values similarly to other younger patients, in order to avoid possible ischemic events and poor oxygenation of the organs (brain, heart, kidney). The aim of this review article is to highlight the importance of treating hypertension in aged population in order to improve their quality of life and lower the incidence of the cardiovascular complications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study was to investigate the health literacy and influencing factors of older population in pension institution of Xinjiang, China. METHODS: Elderly people were selected from 44 pension institutions in Urumqi, Changji, Karamay and Shihezi and from September 2011 to June 2012 using random layer sampling method. The investigation was carried out by Chinese citizen health literacy questionnaire prepared by the China Health Education Center. Data were analyzed by Oneway ANOVA, multiple linear regression and Pearson correlation analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1396 elderly people met the inclusion criteria and their average age was (77.37 +/- 8.48) years. Their average health literacy score was (77.37 +/- 8.48) points, which was at a low level. There was significant difference in health literacy score among the factors of age, gender, race, education, household income, marital status and occupation (P{$<$}0.05). The independent influencing factors of health literacy were education, race, occupation, household income, age and marital status (P {$<$} 0.05). Correlation analysis was conducted between the scores of health knowledge, health belief, health behavior, health skill and total scores of health literacy. Health knowledge scores and total scores had highest correlation (r=0.95), followed by health belief scores and total scores (r=0.81). CONCLUSION: The correlation between health behavior scores and health skill scores was the lowest (r=0.33). The major factors that lead to low health literacy in elderly people are femininity, minority and low levels of education.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Improving health literacy is an important public health goal in many countries. Although many studies have suggested that low health literacy has adverse effects on an individual's health outcomes, confounding factors are often not accounted. This paper examines the interplay between health literacy and chronic disease prevention. METHODS: A population-based sample of 8194 participants aged 15-69\,years old in Ningbo were used from China's 2017 National Health Literacy Surveillance Data. We use multivariate regression analysis to disentangle the relationship between health literacy and chronic disease prevention. RESULTS: We find the association between health literacy and the occurrence of the first chronic condition is attenuated after we adjust the results for age and education. This might arise because having one or more chronic conditions is associated with better knowledge about chronic diseases, thus improve their health literacy. More importantly, we find health literacy is associated with a reduction in the likelihood of having a comorbid condition. However, this protective effect is only found among urban residents, suggesting health literacy might be a key factor explaining the rural-urban disparity in health outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the important role of health literacy in preventing comorbidities instead of preventing the first chronic condition. Moreover, family support could help improve health literacy and result in beneficial effects on health.},

  abstract = {Objective: To understand the health literacy and relevant factors of cancer prevention consciousness in Chinese urban residents from 2015 to 2017. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 16 provinces covered by the Cancer Screening Program in Urban China from 2015 to 2017. A total of 32 257 local residents aged {$\geq$}18 years old who could understand the investigation procedure were included in the study by using the cluster sampling method and convenient sampling method. All local residents were categorized into four groups, which contained 15 524 community residents, 8 016 cancer risk assessment/screening population, 2 289 cancer patients and 6 428 occupational population, respectively. The self-designed questionnaire was used to collect the information of demographic characteristics and cancer prevention consciousness focusing on nine common risk factors, including smoking, alcohol, fiber food, food in hot temperature or pickled food, chewing betel nut, helicobacter pylori, moldy food, hepatitis B infection, estrogen, and exercise. The logistic regression model was adopted to identify the influencing factors. Results: The overall health literacy of the cancer prevention consciousness was 77.4\% (24 980 participants), with 77.4\% (12 018 participants), 79.9\% (6 406 participants), 77.2\% (1 766 participants) and 74.5\% (4 709 participants) in each group (P{$<$}0.001). The correct response rates for nine risk factors ranged from 55.2\% to 93.0\%. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that compared with community residents, people with primary school level education or below, and the number of people living together in the family {$<$}3, the cancer risk assessment/screening intervention population, cancer patients, those with junior high school level educationor above and the number of people living in the family {$\geq$}3 had better health literacy of the cancer prevention consciousness (all P values {$<$}0.05). Compared with females, 39 years old and below, government-affiliated institutions or civil servants, from the eastern region, males, older than 40 years, company or enterprise employees, and from the middle or western region had worse health literacy of the cancer prevention consciousness (all P values {$<$}0.05). Conclusion: The health literacy of the cancer prevention consciousness in Chinese urban residents should be improved. The cancer screening intervention, gender, age, education, occupation, the number of people co-living in the family, and residential region were associated with the health literacy of the cancer prevention consciousness.},

In the past 40 years or so, the income situation in China, India, and other countries has exploded, leading to changes in the way of life and work as well as an increase in the prevalence of diabetes. Metabolic disorders caused by diabetes can lead to secondary vascular complications, which have long-term malignant effects on the heart, kidneys, brain, and other vital organs of patients. Adequate primary prevention measures are needed to reduce the incidence of diabetic vascular complications, and more attention should be given to treatment after the disease. To this end, it is necessary to determine a standardized drug and physical therapy system and to build a more efficient and low-cost chronic disease management system.},

Previous studies generally focused on HIT adoption of a specific adult subsample, e.g., older adults or sexual minorities, while few had encompassed the comprehensive adult population in the U.S. and explored both the individual and societal trends in HIT usage. Capitalizing on five waves of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2022) and applying an age-cohort-period (APC) design, we successfully disentangled the three collinear factors (i.e., age, period and cohort) and explored their respective effects on HIT adoption. Similar to previous studies, age negatively predicts one's HIT usage. We also observed inter-cohort differences in HIT usage, with the baby boomer cohort displaying the highest acceptance of HIT. While the period effects were not statistically significant, it is clear that societal acceptance of HIT has been rising in recent years. Additionally, we explored three heterogeneous factors in the APC effects: gender, race, and education. Gender and race displayed both age- and cohort-related heterogeneity, while education only exhibited age-related heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence and etiology of falls in patients following hip fracture remains poorly understood. METHODS: We prospectively investigated the incidence of, and risk factors for, recurrent and injurious falls in community-dwelling persons admitted for surgical repair of minimal-trauma hip fracture. Fall surveillance methods included phone calls, medical records, and fall calendars. Potential predictors of falls included health status, quality of life, nutritional status, body composition, muscle strength, range of motion, gait velocity, balance, walking endurance, disability, cognition, depression, fear of falling, self-efficacy, social support, physical activity level, and vision. RESULTS: 193 participants enrolled in the study (81 +/- 8 years, 72\% women, gait velocity 0.3 +/- 0.2 m/s). We identified 227 falls in the year after hip fracture for the 178 participants with fall surveillance data. Fifty-six percent of participants fell at least once, 28\% had recurrent falls, 30\% were injured, 12\% sustained a new fracture, and 5\% sustained a new hip fracture. Age-adjusted risk factors for recurrent and injurious falls included lower strength, balance, range of motion, physical activity level, quality of life, depth perception, vitamin D, and nutritional status, and greater polypharmacy, comorbidity, and disability. Multivariate analyses identified older age, congestive heart failure, poorer quality of life, and nutritional status as independent risk factors for recurrent and injurious falls. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent and injurious falls are common after hip fracture and are associated with multiple risk factors, many of which are treatable. Interventions should therefore be tailored to alleviating or reversing any nutritional, physiological, and psychosocial risk factors of individual patients.},

This study aims to validate the Neonatal  Healthcare-associated infectiOn Prediction (NeoHoP) score, designed for LMICs,  across diverse neonatal populations. METHODS: Prospective data from three South  African neonatal units in the Neonatal Sepsis Observational (NeoOBS) study were  analysed. The NeoHoP score, initially developed and validated internally in a  South African hospital, was assessed using an external cohort of 573 sepsis  episodes in 346 infants, focusing on different birth weight categories.  Diagnostic metrics were evaluated, including sensitivity, specificity, positive  predictive value and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.  RESULTS: The external validation cohort displayed higher median birth weight and  gestational age compared with the internal validation cohort. A significant  proportion were born before reaching healthcare facilities, resulting in  increased sepsis evaluation, and diagnosed healthcare-associated infections  (HAIs). Gram-negative infections predominated, with fungal infections more common  in the external validation cohort.The NeoHoP score demonstrated robust diagnostic  performance, with 92\% specificity, 65\% sensitivity and a positive likelihood  ratio of 7.73. Subgroup analysis for very low birth weight infants produced  similar results. The score's generalisability across diverse neonatal populations  was evident, showing comparable performance across different birth weight  categories. CONCLUSION: This multicentre validation confirms the NeoHoP score as  a reliable 'rule-in' test for HAI in neonates, regardless of birth weight. Its  potential as a valuable diagnostic tool in LMIC neonatal units addresses a  critical gap in neonatal care in low-resource settings.},

METHOD: The attention and executive functioning of 40 adults with major depression were compared with those of 40 healthy comparison subjects; 20 subjects were 20-60 years old, and 20 were {$>$} or =61 years. It was hypothesized that depressed subjects, regardless of age, would perform more poorly than comparison subjects on both attention and executive tasks but that the older depressed adults would evidence significantly greater impairment on executive measures. RESULTS: A significant interaction between age and depressive status was noted for tasks of executive functioning, while no age-depression interaction was found for tasks of selective or sustained attention. Older depressed adults demonstrated the slowest psychomotor speed and the poorest performance on tasks requiring set shifting, problem solving, and initiation of novel responses. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with late-life depression have significant impairment in executive functioning. These findings can guide the development of stimulated functional neuroimaging paradigms that may clarify the pathophysiology of geriatric depression. Timely identification of attentional and executive processes fundamental to the daily functioning of depressed older adults may lead to compensatory strategies that will improve the outcomes of late-life depression.},

This paper aims to study the level of generic health literacy among adolescents and to explore associations between health literacy and socio-demographic (age, sex, family affluence, migration background), social (social support by family and friends) and personal (self-efficacy) factors. We conducted a representative cross-sectional online survey. Four health literacy dimensions were captured among 14-17 years old adolescents living in Germany (n = 1235) with the "Measurement of Health Literacy Among Adolescents-Questionnaire" (MOHLAA-Q). Descriptive, bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to analyse the data (n = 1202). We found poor health literacy levels-to varying degrees-in all examined health literacy dimensions: dealing with health-related information (8.41\% with many difficulties), health-related communication skills (28.13\% with low skills), attitudes toward one's own health and health information (8.81\% with passive attitudes) and health-related knowledge (22.73\% with low levels). We identified significant associations between poor health literacy levels and all factors studied except for age. Our results indicate a need for the implementation of evidence-based health literacy-related promoting interventions, preferentially in education and training institutions.},

Prospective diagnostic cohort study. Academic medical center. Subjects more than 10 years of age presenting for evaluation of chronic rhinosinusitis, not responding to 12 weeks of medical treatment, suffering from at least 2 or more of the following symptoms- nasal obstruction, anterior and or posterior nasal discharge, headache or facial pains, and abnormalities of smell were prospectively studied. All selected patients were subjected to nasal endoscopy and CT paranasal sinuses. Endoscopic findings were scored according to Lund Kennedy scoring system. Sinus CT scans were scored with the Lund Mackay scoring system. The clinical diagnosis of CRS was determined on the basis of the published adult sinusitis guideline criteria and nasal endoscopic findings were compared with the diagnostic gold standard CT. A total of 100 patients were studied. Endoscopy was able to diagnose 87 \% as CRS based on Lund--Kennedy score {$\geq$}2. 93 \% patients could be labeled as CRS based on Lund--Mackey score {$\geq$}4. On correlating endoscopy and CT PNS it was found that sensitivity was 88.04 \%, specificity was 28.57 \%, PPV was 94.19 \%, NPV was 15.38 \%. Positive likelihood ratio of 1.23 and negative likelihood ratio of 0.42 was found p value was found to be 0.10565, thereby confirming that there is no significant difference in diagnosing CRS by either modality. The addition of nasal endoscopy helps reduce the use of CT, reducing costs and radiation exposure {\copyright} 2015 Association of Otolaryngologists of India},

  abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical relevance of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), identified by the STOPP criteria, and potential prescribing omissions (PPOs), identified by the START criteria, and to identify predictors for clinically relevant PIMs and PPOs. Methods: The STOPP and START criteria were applied on the medication lists of 200 older hip fracture patients, consecutively recruited to a randomized controlled study in 2009. For each identified PIM and/or PPO, the clinical relevance was assessed at the individual level, using medical records from both hospital and primary care as well as data collected in the original study. Results: A total of 555 PIMs/PPOs were identified in 170 (85\%) patients (median age: 85 years, 67\% female), 298 (54\%) of which, in 141 (71\%) patients, were assessed as clinically relevant. A greater proportion of PIMs than PPOs were clinically relevant: 71\% (95\% CI: 66\%; 76\%) vs. 32\% (27\%; 38\%). A greater proportion of PPOs than PIMs could not be assessed with available information: 38\% (32\%; 44\%) vs. 22\% (17\%; 27\%). Number of drugs and multidose drug dispensing, but not age, sex, cognition, or nursing home residence, were associated with {$\geq$}1 clinically relevant PIMs/PPOs. Conclusions: The present study illustrates that one in two PIMs/PPOs identified by the STOPP/START criteria is clearly clinically relevant, PIMs being clinically relevant to a greater extent than PPOs. Based on available information, the clinical relevance could not be determined in a non-negligible proportion of PIMs/PPOs. Number of drugs and multidose drug dispensing were associated with {$\geq$}1 clinically relevant PIMs/PPOs.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The 75\% of older adults with multiple chronic conditions are at risk of therapeutic competition (i.e. treatment for one condition may adversely affect a coexisting condition). The objective was to determine the prevalence of potential therapeutic competition in community-living older adults. METHODS: Cross-sectional descriptive study of a representative sample of 5,815 community-living adults 65 and older in the U.S, enrolled 2007-2009. The 14 most common chronic conditions treated with at least one medication were ascertained from Medicare claims. Medication classes recommended in national disease guidelines for these conditions and used by {$>$}/= 2\% of participants were identified from in-person interviews conducted 2008-2010. Criteria for potential therapeutic competition included: 1), well-acknowledged adverse medication effect; 2) mention in disease guidelines; or 3) report in a systematic review or two studies published since 2000. Outcomes included prevalence of situations of potential therapeutic competition and frequency of use of the medication in individuals with and without the competing condition. RESULTS: Of 27 medication classes, 15 (55.5\%) recommended for one study condition may adversely affect other study conditions. Among 91 possible pairs of study chronic conditions, 25 (27.5\%) have at least one potential therapeutic competition. Among participants, 1,313 (22.6\%) received at least one medication that may worsen a coexisting condition; 753 (13\%) had multiple pairs of such competing conditions. For example, among 846 participants with hypertension and COPD, 16.2\% used a nonselective beta-blocker. In only 6 of 37 cases (16.2\%) of potential therapeutic competition were those with the competing condition less likely to receive the medication than those without the competing condition. CONCLUSIONS: One fifth of older Americans receive medications that may adversely affect coexisting conditions. Determining clinical outcomes in these situations is a research and clinical priority. Effects on coexisting conditions should be considered when prescribing medications.},

Family caregivers are found to be under intense stress and burden, and to encounter many difficulties preparing themselves, both physically and mentally, for the return home from the hospital of an elderly family member. However, few studies of rehospitalization of the elderly have focused on the point of view of the family caregiver. The purpose of this study was to explore the predictors, especially the needs of the family caregiver, for rehospitalization, within a month after having been discharged, for elderly patients in Taiwan. A prospective, descriptive and correlational study, using 216 elderly patients and their family caregivers from the internal medicine wards of a medical center in Northern Taiwan was conducted. It was found that elderly patients with caregivers requesting help from a support group were 5.3 times more likely to be rehospitalized than those with caregivers that did not request such help. In addition, the odds of rehospitalization for elderly patients with some self-care ability, whose caregiver reported at least one need for social services, was 9.03 (CI=2.32-35.16) times that of those whose caregivers reported no need for social services. Based on the findings of this study, health care providers need to assess the self-care ability of their elderly patients. In addition they should assess the need for support groups and social services to caregivers before the hospital discharge of Taiwanese elders, and perhaps other Chinese populations as well.},

The aim of this study was to assess the association of health literacy with the prevalence of obesity, arterial hypertension (AH), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: This cross-sectional, single-center study included 500 patients (42.2\% male and 57.8\% females; median age, 63 years (interquartile range, 42--73)) hospitalized at General County Hospital in Po{\v z}ega, Croatia, between July and October 2020. The Short Assessment of Health Literacy for Croatian Adults (SAHLCA-50) questionnaire was used. Descriptive statistics (median with interquartile range (IQR), frequency, and percentages) and binary logistic regression were utilized. Results: Patients with AH had an inadequate level of health literacy as compared to those without AH (32 vs. 40 points; Mann--Whitney U test, p {$<$} 0.001). Patients with T2DM scored 31 points versus 39 points in patients without T2DM (Mann--Whitney U test, p {$<$} 0.001). Patients suffering from both AH and T2DM scored 31 points versus 33 points in those with either AH or T2DM and 41 points in patients without AH and T2DM (Kruskal--Wallis test, p {$<$} 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in SAHLCA-50 scores according to the patient body mass index. Conclusions: An inadequate level of health literacy is significantly associated with AH and T2DM but not with obesity. Male gender, low level of education, rural place of residence, retirement, and older age are significant predictors of inadequate health literacy.},

However, their role in clinical practice is undefined. We sought to investigate longitudinal changes in these indicators and their effects on clinical outcomes. METHODS: We used Taiwan's Longitudinal Health Insurance Database to retrieve quarterly information about drug use for people aged 65 years and older over a 10-year period. We analyzed the association between indicators and all-cause admission to hospital, fracture-specific admission to hospital and death using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 59,042 older adults (65-74 yr: 39,358 [66.7\%], 75-84 yr: 16,903 [28.6\%], and {$\geq$} 85 yr: 2781 [4.7\%]). The mean changes in polypharmacy over the course of the study were greatest among patients aged 65-74 years (absolute difference +2.14, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.10-2.19), then among those aged 75-84 yr (+1.79, 95\% CI 1.70-1.88), and finally those aged 85 years and older (+0.71, 95\% CI 0.36-1.05). The number of potentially inappropriate medications increased among patients aged 65-74 years (+0.16 [0.15-0.18]) and 75-84 years (+0.09 [0.06-0.08]), but decreased in those aged 85 years and older (-0.15 [-0.26 to -0.04]). Polypharmacy, potentially inappropriate medications and anticholinergic risk scale were each associated with an increased risk of admission to hospital, but not with death. In addition, both polypharmacy (5-9 drugs: odds ratio [OR] 1.18, 95\% CI 1.12-1.24; {$\geq$} 10 drugs: OR 1.54, 95\% CI 1.42-1.66) and anticholinergic burden (score 1-2: 1.39, 95\% CI 1.31-1.48; {$\geq$} 3: 1.53, 95\% CI 1.41-1.66) showed dose-response relations with fracture-specific admission to hospital. INTERPRETATION: The total number of drugs taken (polypharmacy), number of potentially inappropriate medications and anticholinergic risk changed during follow-up and varied across age groups in this cohort of older adult patients. These indicators showed dose-response relations with admission to hospital, but not with death.},

Finding patient factors affecting their adherence behaviours is important for improving the treatment effect and limiting further disease progression. AIMS: To examine the association between health literacy, self-efficacy, disease knowledge and adherence to secondary coronary artery disease prevention in patients in China. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 598 patients with coronary artery disease were enrolled in two tertiary hospitals in China during a hospitalisation for receiving percutaneous coronary intervention. Patient-reported data were collected on demographics, health literacy, self-efficacy, disease knowledge and adherence to secondary coronary artery disease prevention (medication-taking and heart-healthy lifestyle (exercise, reducing/eliminating alcohol intake and smoking, low salt and fat diet, stress reduction)). Chi-squared tests and regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: The proportions of recalled self-report of adherence to medication-taking and a heart-healthy lifestyle immediately prior to the coronary artery disease hospitalisation were 84.7\% and 53.2\%, respectively. In logistic regression, health literacy, self-efficacy and disease knowledge was significantly associated with non-adherence to secondary coronary artery disease prevention. Limited health literacy demonstrated a 1.61-fold odds for non-adherence to a heart-healthy lifestyle. Each score increase of self-efficacy and disease knowledge had 0.98-fold odds and 1.05-fold odds of non-adherence to a heart-healthy lifestyle. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to medication-taking was relatively good in Chinese patients prior to coronary artery disease hospitalisation, but adherence to heart-healthy lifestyle behaviours should be improved. Health literacy, self-efficacy and disease knowledge should be taken into account when intervening to improve secondary coronary artery disease prevention.},

Seeking patient-related factors influencing changes in adherence over time is necessary for formulating suitable intervention measures-especially among diverse populations. OBJECTIVE: To explore whether health literacy, self-efficacy, and disease knowledge predict changes in adherence over time (between baseline and 3 months) to secondary prevention recommendations for Chinese coronary artery disease patients. METHODS: A longitudinal study was performed for 662 patients following percutaneous coronary intervention in China. Self-reported data were collected at baseline during hospitalization and at a 3-month telephone follow-up. Variables included demographics, health literacy, self-efficacy, disease knowledge, and adherence to secondary prevention recommendations for medication taking and a heart-healthy lifestyle. Multinomial logistic regression identified predictors of adherence changes over time. RESULTS: Patients were categorized into three groups: sustained/declined to nonadherence between baseline and 3 months, improved to adherence, and sustained adherence. The number of patients in sustained/declined to nonadherence group was small. Absence of stents predicted sustained/declined to nonadherence to medication and lifestyle over time. Health literacy was not associated with adherence changes over time. Higher self-efficacy scores were associated with lower likelihood of sustained/declined to nonadherence to a healthy lifestyle over time, whereas higher disease knowledge scores were associated with higher sustained/declined to nonadherence to medication. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to secondary prevention 3 months after discharge was relatively good in Chinese patients with coronary artery disease who received percutaneous coronary intervention. Absence of stents and lower self-efficacy can predict the poor adherence changes, which should be considered in formulating follow-up care.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Earlier studies suggest that children with type 1 diabetes are more likely to have a subsequent diagnosis of celiac disease. However, research is sparse on the risk of subsequent type 1 diabetes in individuals with celiac disease. We sought to determine the risk of subsequent type 1 diabetes diagnosed before the age of 20 years in children and adolescents with celiac disease in a national, general population-based cohort. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified 9,243 children with a diagnosis of celiac disease in the Swedish national inpatient register between 1964 and 2003. We then identified five reference individuals matched at time of diagnosis for age, calendar year, sex, and county (n = 45,680). Only individuals with {$>$}1 year of follow-up after study entry (diagnosis of celiac disease) were included in the analyses. RESULTS: Celiac disease was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of subsequent type 1 diabetes before age 20 years (hazard ratio 2.4 [95\% CI 1.9-3.0], P {$<$} 0.001). This risk increase was seen regardless of whether celiac disease was first diagnosed between 0 and 2 (2.2 [1.7-2.9], P {$<$} 0.001) or 3 and 20 (3.4 [1.9-6.1], P {$<$} 0.001) years of age. Individuals with prior celiac disease were also at increased risk of ketoacidosis or diabetic coma before the age of 20 years (2.3 [1.4-3.9], P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Children with celiac disease are at increased risk of subsequent type 1 diabetes. This risk increase is low considering that 95\% of individuals with celiac disease are HLA-DQ2 positive.},

This paper describes the Swedish personal identity number (PIN) and explores ethical issues of its use in medical research. A ten-digit-PIN is maintained by the National Tax Board for all individuals that have resided in Sweden since 1947. Until January 2008, an estimated 75,638 individuals have changed PIN. The most common reasons for change of PIN are incorrect recording of date of birth or sex among immigrants or newborns. Although uncommon, change of sex always leads to change of PIN since the PIN is sex-specific. The most common reasons for re-use of PIN (n = 15,887), is when immigrants are assigned a PIN that has previously been assigned to someone else. This is sometimes necessary since there is a shortage of certain PIN combinations referring to dates of birth in the 1950s and 1960s. Several ethical issues can be raised pro and con the use of PIN in medical research. The Swedish PIN is a useful tool for linkages between medical registers and allows for virtually 100\% coverage of the Swedish health care system. We suggest that matching of registers through PIN and matching of national health registers without the explicit approval of the individual patient is to the benefit for both the individual patient and for society.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Swedish National Inpatient Register (IPR), also called the Hospital Discharge Register, is a principal source of data for numerous research projects. The IPR is part of the National Patient Register. The Swedish IPR was launched in 1964 (psychiatric diagnoses from 1973) but complete coverage did not begin until 1987. Currently, more than 99\% of all somatic (including surgery) and psychiatric hospital discharges are registered in the IPR. A previous validation of the IPR by the National Board of Health and Welfare showed that 85-95\% of all diagnoses in the IPR are valid. The current paper describes the history, structure, coverage and quality of the Swedish IPR. METHODS AND RESULTS: In January 2010, we searched the medical databases, Medline and HighWire, using the search algorithm "validat* (inpatient or hospital discharge) Sweden". We also contacted 218 members of the Swedish Society of Epidemiology and an additional 201 medical researchers to identify papers that had validated the IPR. In total, 132 papers were reviewed. The positive predictive value (PPV) was found to differ between diagnoses in the IPR, but is generally 85-95\%. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the validity of the Swedish IPR is high for many but not all diagnoses. The long follow-up makes the register particularly suitable for large-scale population-based research, but for certain research areas the use of other health registers, such as the Swedish Cancer Register, may be more suitable.},

From July 1, 2017, it became mandatory again for both sexes but the proportion of summoned people for standardised testing has so far been low. This paper describes the history, structure and content of the Swedish Military Conscription Register (SMCR). We retrieved information about the SMCR from written sources and through e-mail interviews with key personnel at the Swedish Defence Conscription and Assessment Agency. We also analysed data from the SMCR between 1969 and 2018. Between 1969 and 2018 the SMCR contains digital data on approximately 2 million individuals (98.6\% men). Most conscripts were born between 1951 and 1988 (n\,=\,1,900,000; tested between 1969 and 2006). For the 1951-1987 birth cohorts, the register has a population coverage of approximately 90\% for men. Conscripts underwent written tests focusing on verbal, spatial, logical and technical ability, medical, physical, and psychological tests. The medical assessment included hearing, vision, muscle and exercise capacity, height, weight, blood pressure and resting heart rate. The SMCR has been widely used to study, e.g., obesity, cardiovascular disease, mental health, crime, cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, sick leave and disability pension. Severe disease could qualify for exemption from military service. Thus, the prevalence of such diseases is underestimated in the SMCR population. Between 1990 and 2018, about 25,000 women also volunteered for testing. The SMCR contains population-based data on physical and psychological health in about 90\% of all men born between 1951 and 1987 (corresponding to testing between 1969 and 2006), and can be used to address a host of research questions.},

The estimand is the target quantity---the purpose of the statistical analysis. Much attention is already placed on how to do estimation; a similar degree of care should be given to defining the thing we are estimating. We advocate that authors state the central quantity of each analysis---the theoretical estimand---in precise terms that exist outside of any statistical model. In our framework, researchers do three things: (1) set a theoretical estimand, clearly connecting this quantity to theory; (2) link to an empirical estimand, which is informative about the theoretical estimand under some identification assumptions; and (3) learn from data. Adding precise estimands to research practice expands the space of theoretical questions, clarifies how evidence can speak to those questions, and unlocks new tools for estimation. By grounding all three steps in a precise statement of the target quantity, our framework connects statistical evidence to theory.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study evaluated a novel composite measure of health literacy and numeracy by assessing its predictive validity for diabetes self-care activities and glycemic control. METHODS: Patients (N = 102) with type 2 diabetes were recruited from a family medicine clinic at an academic medical center. Combined health literacy was assessed by combining the results of the Health Literacy Scale and the Subjective Numeracy Scale. Self-management activities were assessed by the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities scale. Hemoglobin A1c (A1c) values were extracted from patients' medical records to assess glycemic control. Path models were used to test the predicted pathways linking health literacy and numeracy, independently and together, to self-management activities and glycemic control. RESULTS: The mean combined literacy score was 72.0 (range, 33-104); the mean health literacy score alone was 43.9 (range, 14-56); and the mean numeracy score alone was 28.1 (range, 8-48). The direct effects results showed that the combined health literacy score (B = 0.107, P {$<$} .05) and the health literacy score alone (B = 0.234, P {$<$} .05) were significantly associated with self-care activities. The health literacy score alone also had a significant direct effect on A1c (B = -0.081, P {$<$} .05). The indirect effects of the combined health literacy on glycemic control through self-care activities were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest that the combined health literacy has predictive validity for self-care activities whereas the health literacy alone has predictive validity for glycemic control. More research is needed to validate these findings. Higher patient health literacy skills were not consistently associated with higher perceived numeracy skills. Additional attention and efforts should be made to make sure patients understand medical instructions involving numerical calculations.},

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: The Primary Care Residents' Clinic at Virginia Commonwealth University Health System (VCUHS). PATIENTS: Those who received a Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine-Revised (REALM-R) assessment at the clinic between June 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010, and utilized the VCUHS outpatient pharmacies to fill their prescriptions. A total of 648 individuals were identified. INTERVENTIONS: The degree of health literacy and level of medication adherence were analyzed per patient by accessing the clinic's electronic health records. The number of medications each patient filled was determined using VCUHS outpatient pharmacy databases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: To determine if there are any associations among the degree of health literacy, the level of medication adherence, and the amount of medications a patient is taking. RESULTS: There was a significant association found between the level of medication adherence and the degree of polypharmacy. We found no association between the degree of health literacy and the level of adherence to a prescribed medication regimen. Additionally, there was no relationship between the degree of polypharmacy and health literacy. Those patients with more medications were also found to have lower levels of medication adherence and vice versa. CONCLUSION: Our study does not show an association between health literacy and medication adherence nor between health literacy and polypharmacy. Thus, potential changes to improving health literacy may not have a significant effect on adherence.},

INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Elderly inpatients aged 65 years or older, discharged from acute care and post-acute care rehabilitation hospitals to home. TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS: The review focused on the six keys components of Naylor's Transitional Care Model: early geriatric assessment, discharge preparation, patient or caregiver's participation, continuity of care, day of discharge assessment and post-discharge follow-up. TYPES OF STUDIES: This review considered randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, before and after studies, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies and analytical cross-sectional studies. OUTCOMES: The outcomes for this review were functional ability, symptoms management, adverse outcomes, unmet needs after discharge, coping with disease, health-related quality of life (QoL), satisfaction with care, readmission rate and healthcare utilization. SEARCH STRATEGY: A systematic search was undertaken across 13 databases to retrieve published and unpublished studies in English between 2000 and 2015. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Critical appraisal was undertaken by two independent reviewers using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). DATA EXTRACTION: Quantitative data were extracted from included studies independently by the two reviewers using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-MAStARI. DATA SYNTHESIS: Due to the wide range of outcome measures, a comprehensive meta-analysis for all studies was not possible. However, meta-analysis was conducted for specific outcome measures, such as readmission, length of stay and QoL. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Two out of the 13 studies were pilot studies and one had a pre-post design. Included studies involved a total of 3964 participants with a median age of 77 years. Nurse discharge planning did not significantly reduce hospital readmission rate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.73, 95\% confidence intervals [CIs] = 0.53-1.01, P = 0.06). The overall effect score for length of stay was significant (weighted mean difference = 0.29, P {$<$} 0.01), suggesting that discharge planning increased the length of hospitalization. The effectiveness of discharge planning did not significantly impact QoL (mental OR = 0.37, P = 0.19 and physical OR = 0.47, P = 0.15). CONCLUSION: Findings of this review suggest that nursing discharge planning for elderly inpatients discharged home increases length of stay, yet neither reduces readmission rates nor improves QoL.},

However, it is difficult to measure the experience in a way that is clinically relevant and useful. METHODS: The author examined the literature relating to the assessment and measurement of quality of life as influenced by oral health. RESULTS: It is difficult to interpret the clinical relevance of measurements from questionnaires or structured interviews that use predetermined response options to indicate health-related quality of life. In contrast, open-ended interviews and focus groups have helped to clarify the mouth's effect on the quality of life of older people. They also have helped to construct a new model of oral health that is consistent with current concepts of aging and disability. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The new model of oral health offers the possibility of developing interviews and questionnaires using language that has the scope and sensitivity needed to reveal the positive strategies that older people use to manage their oral health and quality of life.},

This paper explores some of the common immunization myths that clinicians may face. It is essential that health professionals have access to accurate information and are able to respond appropriately to parental concerns. This involves good communication; listening, empathy and tailoring advice to the specific concerns of the parent. Finally, health professionals need to provide consistent messages based on solid research evidence.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: South Africa has a double burden of high neonatal mortality and maternal HIV prevalence. Common to both is a proinflammatory in utero and  perinatal milieu. The aim of this study was to determine cytokine profiles in HIV  exposed (HE) and HIV unexposed (HU) very low birthweight (VLBW) infants and to  determine whether these were associated with predischarge outcomes. DESIGN:  Single-centre, prospective cohort study conducted from 1 June 2017 to 31 January  2019. PATIENTS: Inborn infants with birth weight of {$<$}1500\,g were enrolled and  cord blood was collected for interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha  (TNF-{$\alpha$}) assays. Participants provided informed consent and ethics approval was  obtained. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was umbilical cord cytokine  levels according to maternal HIV status. Secondary outcomes included death and/or  serious neonatal infection, necrotising enterocolitis, intraventricular  haemorrhage, periventricular leucomalacia, chronic lung disease and  haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus before discharge. RESULTS:  A total of 279 cases were included with 269 cytokine assays performed on 122 HEs  and 147 HUs. Median IL-6 levels were 53.0\,pg/mL in HEs and 21.0\,pg/mL in HUs  (p=0.07). Median TNF-{$\alpha$} levels were 7.2\,pg/mL in HEs and 6.5\,pg/mL in HUs (p=0.6).  There was significantly more late-onset sepsis in the HE group compared with the  HU group (41.2\% vs 27.9\%) (p=0.03). IL-6 levels were significantly higher for  those with any adverse outcome (p=0.006) and death and/or any adverse outcome  (p=0.0001). TNF-{$\alpha$} levels did not differ according to predischarge outcomes.  CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference in IL-6 and TNF-{$\alpha$} levels in cord  blood of HE compared with HU VLBWs. However, IL-6 levels are significantly higher  in VLBWs with adverse predischarge outcomes, and VLBW HEs are at increased risk  of adverse predischarge outcomes compared with HUs, particularly late-onset  sepsis.},

  abstract = {We compared ecometric neighbourhood scores of social capital (contextual variation) to mean neighbourhood scores (individual and contextual variation), using several health-related outcomes (i.e. self-rated health, weight status and obesity-related behaviours). Data were analysed from 5,900 participants in the European SPOTLIGHT survey. Factor analysis of the 13-item social capital scale revealed two social capital constructs: social networks and social cohesion. The associations of ecometric and mean neighbourhood-level scores of these constructs with self-rated health, weight status and obesity-related behaviours were analysed using multilevel regression analyses, adjusted for key covariates. Analyses using ecometric and mean neighbourhood scores, but not mean neighbourhood scores adjusted for individual scores, yielded similar regression coefficients. Higher levels of social network and social cohesion were not only associated with better self-rated health, lower odds of obesity and higher fruit consumption, but also with prolonged sitting and less transport-related physical activity. Only associations with transport-related physical activity and sedentary behaviours were associated with mean neighbourhood scores adjusted for individual scores. As analyses using ecometric scores generated the same results as using mean neighbourhood scores, but different results when using mean neighbourhood scores adjusted for individual scores, this suggests that the theoretical advantage of the ecometric approach (i.e. teasing out individual and contextual variation) may not be achieved in practice. The different operationalisations of social network and social cohesion were associated with several health outcomes, but the constructs that appeared to represent the contextual variation best were only associated with two of the outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Online support groups (OSGs) are one way for people with chronic diseases, their family or friends, and health professionals to communicate, gain information, and provide social support. As the number of peer-to-peer OSGs for chronic musculoskeletal conditions grows, it is important to gain insight into the different designs of groups available, who is accessing them, if and how they may be effective, and what strategies are being used to implement or increase consumer engagement. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this systematic review of people with musculoskeletal conditions were to (1) describe the design features (functions, usage options, moderation, and expert input) of peer-to-peer OSGs, (2) describe the characteristics of the individuals using peer-to-peer OSGs, (3) synthesize the evidence on outcomes of participation, and (4) identify strategies used in the delivery and maintenance of OSGs. METHODS: A search comprising terms related to the population (people with musculoskeletal disorders) and the intervention (peer-to-peer OSGs) was conducted in 6 databases. Results were filtered from 1990 (internet inception) to February 2019. Studies identified in the search were screened according to predefined eligibility criteria using a 2-step process. Quantitative studies were appraised by 2 reviewers using the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions tool. Qualitative studies were appraised by 2 different reviewers using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. Extracted data were synthesized narratively. RESULTS: We examined 21 studies with low to moderate risk of bias. Of these studies, 13 studies included OSGs hosted on public platforms, 11 studies examined OSGs that were conducted in English, and 6 studies used moderators or peer leaders to facilitate engagement. Studies either reported the number of OSG members (n=1985 across all studies) or the number of posts (range: 223-200,000). The majority of OSG members were females who were not full-time employees and with varied levels of education. There were no randomized controlled trials measuring the efficacy of OSGs. Qualitative and quantitative studies identified empowerment, social support, self-management behavior, and health literacy as primary constructs to measure OSG efficacy. Neutral or marginal improvement was reported in these constructs. Sharing experiences and a greater level of engagement appeared to have an important influence on OSGs efficacy. The extent to which members posted on the website influenced engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Across a diverse range of designs, languages, included features, and delivery platforms, peer-to-peer OSGs for chronic musculoskeletal conditions attract predominantly female participants of all ages and education levels. The level of participation of a member appears to be related to their perceived benefit, health literacy, and empowerment. Future studies are needed to identify which design and maintenance strategies have superior efficacy and whether there are concomitant improvements in health outcomes for people with chronic musculoskeletal conditions resulting from participation in OSGs.

This discourse creates the question "Can we live longer or better?" and encompasses issues of quality versus quantity, dependency versus autonomy, and risk versus benefit. By positing this discourse as a dichotomous tension, the development can be traced through the examination of select examples of influential studies in the field of aging. For nursing, the risk of these continued oppositions is potential oversimplification that may limit discernment of the complexities of care of older adults. Through understanding of the evolution and imposition of this dichotomizing discourse, nursing can provide older adult care within the reality of the aging experience, and develop frameworks, theories, and multidisciplinary discursive practice to optimize nursing care in the real-world spaces that exist between antiaging and healthy aging boundaries.},

Although the  incidence of invasive GBS disease is reportedly low in South Asia, there is  disconnect between prevalence of maternal recto-vaginal colonization and the  incidence of early-onset disease (EOD). This is possibly due to  case-ascertainment biases that omit investigation of newborns dying on day-0 of  life, which accounts for {$>$}90\% of EOD. Furthermore, GBS is associated with  approximately 15\% of all infection related stillbirths. Vaccination of pregnant  women with a serotype-specific polysaccharide epitope vaccine could possibly  protect against EOD and late-onset disease (LOD) in their infants through  transplacental transfer of serotype-specific capsular antibody. Furthermore,  vaccination of pregnant women might also protect against impaired  neurodevelopment following GBS associated neonatal sepsis, and fetal  loss/stillbirths. Licensure of a GBS vaccine might be feasible based on safety  evaluation and a sero-correlate of protection, with vaccine effectiveness  subsequently being demonstrated in phase IV studies. A randomized-controlled  trial would, however, be best suited as a vaccine-probe to fully characterize the  contribution of GBS to neonatal sepsis associated morbidity and mortality and  adverse fetal outcomes.},

  abstract = {The IDF Diabetes Atlas is an authoritative source of evidence on the prevalence of diabetes, related morbidity and mortality, as well as diabetes-related health expenditures at global, regional and national levels. The IDF Diabetes Atlas also introduces readers to the pathophysiology of diabetes, its classification and its diagnostic criteria. It presents the global picture of diabetes for different types of diabetes and populations and provides information on specific actions that can be taken, such as proven measures to prevent type 2 diabetes and best management of all forms of diabetes to avoid subsequent complications. The credibility of diabetes estimates relies on the rigorous methods used for the selection and analysis of high-quality data sources. For every edition, the IDF Diabetes Atlas Committee -- composed of thematic experts from each of the seven IDF Regions -- reviews the methods underlying the IDF Diabetes Atlas estimates and projections and available data sources. The majority of the data sources used are population-based studies that have been published in peer-reviewed journals. In this edition, we have also included data from national diabetes registries. With the establishment of electronic records and national registries becoming more common, we anticipate more data like these will be featured in the future. Furthermore, information from national health surveys, including some of the World Health Organization (WHO) STEPwise approach to Surveillance (STEPS), are used where they meet inclusion criteria. Findings of the current 10th edition confirm that diabetes is one of the fastest growing global health emergencies of the 21st century. In 2021, it is estimated that 537 million people have diabetes, and this number is projected to reach 643 million by 2030, and 783 million by 2045. In addition, 541 million people are estimated to have impaired glucose tolerance in 2021. It is also estimated that over 6.7 million people aged 20--79 will die from diabetes-related causes in 2021. The number of children and adolescents (i.e. up to 19 years old) living with diabetes increases annually. In 2021, over 1.2 million children and adolescents have type 1 diabetes. Direct health expenditures due to diabetes are already close to one trillion USD and will exceed this figure by 2030. This IDF Diabetes Atlas 10th edition also shows that hyperglycaemia in pregnancy (HIP) affects approximately one in six pregnancies. Another cause for alarm is the consistently high percentage (45\%) of people with undiagnosed diabetes, which is overwhelmingly type 2. This highlights the urgent need to improve the ability to diagnose people with diabetes, many of whom are unaware they have diabetes, and provide appropriate and timely care for all people with diabetes as early as possible.},

MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched from January 1, 1986 to June 30, 2013) to identify relevant articles in people aged {$>$} 65 years. AREAS COVERED: We present information about: i) prevalence of polypharmacy and unnecessary medication use; ii) negative consequences of polypharmacy; and iii) interventions to improve polypharmacy. EXPERT OPINION: International research shows that polypharmacy is common in older adults with the highest number of drugs taken by those residing in nursing homes. Nearly 50\% of older adults take one or more medications that are not medically necessary. Research has clearly established a strong relationship between polypharmacy and negative clinical consequences. Moreover, well-designed interprofessional (often including clinical pharmacist) intervention studies that focus on enrolling high-risk older patients with polypharmacy have shown that they can be effective in reducing aspects of unnecessary prescribing with mixed results on distal health outcomes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel conceptual framework combining the concepts of health literacy and life-course to guide public health planning and research. Health literacy is a key competence that enables individuals to navigate health-care systems and health promotion activities. The life-course perspective places emphasis on how disease risk accumulates along the life trajectory from fetal life onwards, and how it can even pass from one generation to the next. Our conceptual framework illustrates how different domains of health literacy are required, and how the unequal distribution of health literacy may be influenced by social determinants at different times in the life-course. Thus, it is essential to disaggregate health literacy into sub-themes and analyse them as they unfold in a long-term life-course perspective. The suggested framework would allow these patterns to be mapped, thereby enabling public health planners to strategically target health literacy promotion programmes to the right population segments at the right time.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Babies born via caesarean section in low-income settings face a higher risk of early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS), which has greater mortality  than late-onset sepsis. However, maternal factors contributing to EONS among  caesarean-delivered babies in these settings, including Uganda, are not well  documented. We determined maternal factors associated with EONS among term babies  delivered by caesarian section at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH),  southwestern Uganda. METHODS: We conducted an unmatched case-control study at  MRRH from December 2019 to March 2020. Cases were caesarean section-delivered  term babies with EONS (within 72~h). Controls were caesarean section-delivered  term babies without EONS. We enrolled mother-baby pairs for both groups,  obtaining maternal data via structured questionnaires The diagnosis of EONS was  made using the WHO Young Infant Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses  algorithm. Cases were consecutively recruited while controls were recruited by  simple random sampling in a ratio of 1:2. We excluded newborns whose mothers were  too ill to consent. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to  identify maternal factors associated with EONS. RESULTS: We enrolled 52 cases and  104 controls. The mean age for the mothers was 27 ({\textpm}\,5.5) years. Neonates born to  referred mothers had higher odds of EONS than those born to non-referred mothers  (AOR\,=\,6.2, 95\% CI: 1.8-21). Additionally, decision-to-delivery time\,{$>$}\,1~h for  emergency caesarean section (AOR\,=\,16, 95\% CI: 4.2-65), antepartum hemorrhage  (AOR\,=\,8.0, 95\% CI: 1.6-40), primiparity (AOR\,=\,4.8, 95\% CI: 1.1-21), and {$>$}\,3  vaginal examinations after membrane rupture (AOR\,=\,4.3, 95\% CI: 1.5-12) were  associated with EONS. CONCLUSIONS: Prime gravidity, antepartum hemorrhage,  multiple vaginal examinations after membrane rupture, long decision-to-delivery  time, and referral status were associated with EONS among term babies delivered  by caesarean section at MRRH. To reduce EONS risk, clinicians should limit  post-membrane rupture vaginal exams or consider prophylactic antibiotics if  multiple exams are needed. Screening babies born to primiparous women, those  referred, those with antepartum hemorrhage, multiple vaginal exams after  membranes rupture, and long decision-to-delivery times, could aid prompt  recognition of EONS and timely interventions. Implementing standard procedures to  reduce caesarean decision-to-delivery time could reduce risk for EONS in this  setting.},

A costcontainment and a cost-pressure scenario are provided together with sensitivity analysis. On average across OECD countries, total health and long-term care expenditure is projected to increase by 3.3 and 7.7 percentage points of GDP between 2010 and 2060 in the cost-containment and the cost-pressure scenarios respectively.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between physical frailty and risk of disability, and to identify the component(s) of frailty with the most impact on disability in community-dwelling older adults. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A Japanese community. PARTICIPANTS: 4341 older adults aged {$>$}/=65 living in the community participated in a baseline assessment from 2011 to 2012 and were followed for 2 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Care-needs certification in the national long-term care insurance (LTCI) system of Japan, type of physical frailty (robust, prefrail, frail) and subitems (slowness, weakness, exhaustion, low activity, weight loss), adjusted for several potential confounders such as demographic characteristics, analysed with Kaplan-Meier survival curves for incidence of disability by frailty phenotype. RESULTS: During the 2-year follow-up period, 168 participants (3.9\%) began using the LTCI system for incidence of disability. Participants classified as frail (HR 4.65, 95\% CI 2.63 to 8.22) or prefrail (2.52, 1.56 to 4.07) at the baseline assessment had an increased risk of disability incidence compared with robust participants. Analyses for subitems of frailty showed that slowness (2.32, 1.62 to 3.33), weakness (1.90, 1.35 to 2.68) and weight loss (1.61, 1.13 to 2.31) were related to increased risk of disability incidence. In stratified analyses, participants who were classified as frail and who had lower cognitive function had the highest percentage (30.3\%) of disability incidence during the 2 years after baseline assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Physical frailty, even being prefrail, had a strong impact on the risk of future disability. Some components of frailty, such as slowness, weakness and weight loss, are strongly associated with incident disability in community-dwelling older adults.},

  abstract = {Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of curable bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide. It manifests primarily as urethritis in males and endocervicitis in females. Untreated chlamydial infection in man can cause epididymitis and proctitis. Though most women with Chlamydia infection are asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms, some develop salpingitis, endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy and tubal factor infertility. It is associated with an increased risk for the transmission or acquisition of HIV and is also attributed to be a risk factor for the development of cervical carcinoma. Early diagnosis and treatment of infected individuals is required to prevent the spread of the disease and severe sequelae. Traditionally, tissue culture was considered the gold standard for the diagnosis. However, with the availability of newer diagnostic techniques particularly molecular methods which are not only highly sensitive and specific but are cost-effective also, the diagnosis has became fast and easy. The purpose of this review is to study the various aspects of genital C. trachomatis infection. Also the advances related to the clinical picture, various diagnostic modalities, prevention, treatment, drug resistance and control measures will be dealt with.},

One third of primary health care physicians from the whole of Sweden received a questionnaire about their workload. CNI, UPA and Townsend scores were calculated using information from the Swedish census of 1990 and the registers of unemployment and migration for 1992. The Swedish GPs weighted some of the variables quite differently from the GPs in the UK. This may be important, especially at the SAMS level. The GPs in both countries considered that older people living alone contributed most to their workload. However, in Sweden the physicians ranked foreign-born people high compared with the English doctors, and in England the GPs ranked children under five years much higher than the doctors in Sweden. The correlation between the scores was high.},

Admission rates for all psychiatric inpatients from Malmo aged 20-79 years, admitted to the psychiatric and alcohol clinics from 1 January 1991 to 31 December 1994, were calculated. The relationship between the CNI and psychiatric admissions was analysed by applying a Poisson regression model. The results are shown as incidence density ratios (IDR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI). From the most deprived areas, the first psychiatric admission rate was more than four times higher than in the most affluent areas. The rates of second and third admission were even higher. Admissions to the alcohol clinic were similar to psychiatric admissions, but the most deprived areas had first admission rates about ten times higher than in the most affluent areas. About 27\% of first admissions, including patients from both psychiatric and alcohol clinics, had a diagnosis of psychosis, and 43\% were substance abusers. There were differences between the patients' diagnoses in different areas. The correlation between the CNI and Townsend scores was very high. The most important finding of this study is the strong correlation between social deprivation, based on different deprivation indices, and first admissions to psychiatric and alcohol clinics.},

DESIGN: This study analyses the extent to which the decline in all-cause mortality and CHD mortality (over the age range 25-74 y) differs between affluent and deprived neighbourhoods during the decade 1984-1993. Incidence density ratios (IDR), estimated by Poisson regression, were calculated for small areas, grouped into population deciles, by both the care need index (CNI) and the Townsend deprivation score. On average, there were about 14 500 residents and 560 deaths in each decile over the period. SETTING: A large Swedish city. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause mortality and mortality from CHD. RESULTS: The most deprived neighbourhoods had the highest IDR for all-cause mortality and CHD mortality. Over the period from 1984-1988 to 1989-1993 there was an overall decrease in all-cause mortality and CHD mortality, which was significantly higher in the most affluent areas. The mortality ratios for the most deprived neighbourhoods were almost three times higher than those of the most affluent areas. CONCLUSIONS: People liviing in more affluent neighbourhoods have had the benefit of most of the last decade's decline in CHD mortality.},

Using data from the Swedish Level of Living Survey, neighbourhood social position is measured by a composite Care Need Index, (CNI) together with such indicators of individual socio-economic position as occupation and housing tenure, with adjustment for age, sex, marital status and social network. Data came from 22,236 people aged 25-74, and were collected from 1988 to 1992. The cross-sectional data were analysed using a hierarchical logistic regression model. In a second analysis, each participant was followed from the initial interview until his or her death, or until the termination of data collection (31 December 1996). A neighbourhood's low social position and an individual resident's low socio-economic position (i.e., a manual worker, or person renting a flat) were found to be associated with increased risk of long-term illness. We conclude that a neighbourhood's low socio-economic position, that is, a high score on the CNI, is a risk factor for long-standing illness above and beyond an individual's socio-economic position. The differences in mortality could be explained by the included independent individual variables.},

  abstract = {Older adults make up the fastest growing age group in North America. This has demanded increased attention in supporting the health and well-being of this population and, in particular, the role of health information in promoting the health and well-being of older adults. Increased availability and accessibility of information as well as a greater emphasis on self-management and care have raised concern about an individual's health literacy skills. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic literature review using explicit systematic literature review methodology. This includes a detailed online search process of recent publications on programs that focus on health literacy in the older adult population using the Rychetnik et al. guiding questions and the Population Intervention Comparison Outcome framework. The search yielded nine articles describing functional (n = 4) and interactive (n = 5) health literacy programs. Overall, the selected articles demonstrated positive outcomes in supporting the health literacy skills of older adults. However, there are limitations in study designs and evaluation measures and outcomes of the programs remain unknown in demonstrating long-term impact in supporting health literacy skills. Further high quality studies with clear and strong research methodology are needed to develop and evaluate evidence-based interactive health literacy programs targeted specifically to older adults.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that in the treated fraction of the hypertensive population, blood pressure (BP) control is less common for systolic BP (SBP) than for diastolic BP (DBP) as measured in the physician's office. Whether this phenomenon is artifactually attributable to a temporary increase in BP owing to a "white-coat" effect or represents a true rarity of SBP control in daily life is unknown.Data were obtained from the PAMELA (Pressioni Arteriose Monitorate E Loro Associazioni) study population, which involved individuals ranging in age from 25 to 74 years who were representative of the residents of Monza (a city near Milan, Italy) and who were stratified according to sex. Office (an average of 3 sphygmomanometric measurements), home (an average of morning and evening self-measurements using a semiautomatic device), and 24-hour ambulatory (average of measurements performed every 20 minutes during the day and at night) BP values were obtained in all study subjects. In the treated hypertensive patients, BP was regarded as controlled if office values were less than 140 (SBP) or 90 (DBP) mm Hg. Home and 24-hour average SBP and DBP were regarded as controlled if the values were lower than 132/83 and 125/79 mm Hg, respectively.In the study participants (n = 2051), the number of patients with hypertension who were receiving antihypertensive treatment was 398, or approximately 42\% of all individuals with hypertension. In-office SBP control by treatment was less frequent than DBP control (29.9\% vs 41.5\%, P\&lt;.05). This was also the case when home and 24-hour SBP and DBP control was considered (38.3\% vs 54.6\% and 50.8 vs 64.9\%, respectively, P\&lt;.05 for both).In the PAMELA population, SBP control by treatment was much less frequent than DBP control by treatment. This was the case not only for office BP values but also for home and 24-hour BP values, demonstrating that inadequate SBP control is not limited to artificial BP-measuring methods but occurs in daily life.Arch Intern Med. 2002;162:582-586--{$>$}}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data on the aetiology of neonatal sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence, aetiology and  outcomes of physician-diagnosed sepsis in hospitalised neonates who had  previously been discharged home after delivery in Soweto, South Africa. METHODS:  A retrospective review using data abstracted from clinical and laboratory  databases identified physician-diagnosed sepsis cases in neonates admitted to the  general paediatric wards at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital from January  2015 to September 2016. Neonates with physician-diagnosed sepsis were categorised  into two groups based on putative pathogens recovered from blood and/or  cerebrospinal fluid specimens: (i) culture-confirmed sepsis; and (ii)  culture-negative sepsis. RESULTS: Of 1~826 neonatal admissions, 1~025 (56.2\%) had  physician-diagnosed sepsis: 166 (16.2\%) with culture-confirmed sepsis and 859  (83.8\%) with culture-negative neonatal sepsis. The commonest pathogens causing  culture-confirmed neonatal sepsis were Streptococcus viridans (n=53; 26.5\%), S.  agalactiae (n=38; 19.0\%), and Staphylococcus aureus (n=25; 12.5\%). The case  fatality rates for culture-confirmed sepsis and culture-negative sepsis were  10.8\% (18/166) and 2.6\% (22/859), respectively. The odds of death occurring  during hospitalisation was 10-fold (95\% confidence interval 3.7 - 26.9) higher in  neonates with culture-confirmed sepsis compared with culture-negative sepsis.  CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, physician-diagnosed sepsis represents a huge disease  burden in previously healthy neonates hospitalised from home. Most sepsis cases  were attributed to S. viridans, S. agalactiae and S. aureus.},

Therefore, there may be a failure to maintain homeostasis under conditions of physiological stress. The reduced homeostatic ability affects different regulatory systems in different subjects, thus explaining at least partly the increased interindividual variability occurring as people get older. Important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes occur with advancing age. Pharmacokinetic changes include a reduction in renal and hepatic clearance and an increase in volume of distribution of lipid soluble drugs (hence prolongation of elimination half-life) whereas pharmacodynamic changes involve altered (usually increased) sensitivity to several classes of drugs such as anticoagulants, cardiovascular and psychotropic drugs. This review focuses on the main age-related physiological changes affecting different organ systems and their implications for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Health literacy is commonly associated with many of the antecedents of health disparities. Yet the precise nature of the relationship between health literacy and disparities remains unclear. A systematic review was conducted to better understand in how far the relationship between health literacy and health disparities has been systematically studied and which potential relationships and pathways have been identified. METHODS: Five databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE and CINAHL, were searched for peer-reviewed studies. Publications were included in the review when they (1) included a valid measure of health literacy, (2) explicitly conceived a health disparity as related to a social disparity, such as race/ethnicity or education and (3) when results were presented by comparing two or more groups afflicted by a social disparity investigating the effect of health literacy on health outcomes. Two reviewers evaluated each study for inclusion and abstracted relevant information. Findings were ordered according to the disparities identified and the role of health literacy in explaining them. RESULTS: 36 studies were included in the final synthesis. Most of the studies investigated racial/ethnic disparities, followed by some few studies that systematically investigated educational disparities. Some evidence was found on the mediating function of health literacy on self-rated health status across racial/ethnic and educational disparities, as well as on the potential effect of health literacy and numeracy on reducing racial/ethnic disparities in medication adherence and understanding of medication intake. CONCLUSION: Overall the evidence on the relationship between health literacy and disparities is still mixed and fairly limited. Studies largely varied with regard to health(-related) outcomes under investigation and the health literacy assessments used. Further, many studies lacked a specific description of the nature of the disparity that was explored and a clear account of possible pathways tested.},

Between July and December 2016, blood  culture was performed in neonates with clinical features of sepsis and  neonates/mothers/guardians were screened for ESBL colonization. Selected isolates  underwent whole genome sequencing to investigate relatedness. Logistic regression  analysis was performed to determine predictors for ESBL-PE associated neonatal  sepsis and mortality. Neonatal ESBL-PE sepsis was detected in 32(10.5\%) of the  304 neonates investigated. Neonatal ESBL-PE sepsis was independently predicted by  admission at the Intensive care Unit and positive mother and neonate ESBL-PE  colonization. Deaths occurred in 55(18.1\%) of neonates. Neonates infected with  ESBL-PE, admitted at ICU, increased age and those transferred from other centres  had significantly high mortality rates. Gram-negative bacteria formed the  majority (76\%) of the isolates, of which 77\% were ESBL-PE. Virulent Klebsiella  pneumoniae ST45 carrying bla(CTX-M-15) were commonly isolated from neonates.  Klebsiella pneumoniae (ST45) were the predominant cause of ESBL-PE neonatal  sepsis and mortality. Improved infection control and antibiotic stewardship are  crucial in controlling the spread of resistant strains. Rapid diagnostic tests to  detect ESBL-PE in low-income countries are needed to guide treatment and reduce  ESBL-PE-associated mortality.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Delivering women and neonates are at a great risk of acquiring infections due to a lack of adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC),  a low level of immunity and extended exposure to care procedures that can lead to  infections. This prospective cohort study aims to assess the level of adherence  to IPC among healthcare workers and its impact on puerperal and neonatal sepsis  in the Dodoma region. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The level of adherence to IPC is  examined cross-sectionally among healthcare workers (HCWs) in contact with  delivering women and their neonates. A prospective cohort approach is used to  assess the level of exposure of 294 delivering women and their neonates to poor  hygienic practices of HCWs through an observation checklist. Outcomes, including  the incidence of puerperal and neonatal sepsis, are evaluated clinically 2\,days  later before discharge. Laboratory culture and sensitivity confirmatory tests of  blood samples are done on positive cases. Data analysis for level of adherence to  IPC practices, incidence of puerperal and neonatal sepsis, and relative risk  among the exposed women and neonates will be performed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION:  The University of Dodoma Research Ethics Committee approved this study (ref no.  MA.84/261/'A'/25). Findings of this study will be published in international  peer-reviewed journals and disseminated at international conferences to the  participating hospitals, the University of Dodoma and the Tanzanian Ministry of  Health for informing practice and policy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Unplanned hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge is considered a "sentinel event" for poor quality. Patients at high risk for this adverse event could be targeted for interventions designed to reduce their risk of readmission. The purpose of this study was to identify patient characteristics and risk factors at discharge associated with unplanned readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We performed a matched case-control study among patients in a Medicare managed care plan who had been admitted to an academic hospital. The cases were patients aged 65 years or older who were urgently or emergently readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. One control patient who was not readmitted within 30 days was matched to each case by principal diagnosis. The medical records of the first admission of the cases and the admission of the controls underwent review (blinded to case-control status) to determine the patient's baseline demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, previous health care utilization, and functional status. The records were also reviewed to assess risk factors on discharge, including clinical instability, inability to ambulate and feed, mental status changes, number of discharge medications, and discharge disposition. RESULTS: Five factors were independently associated (P {$<$} 0.05) with unplanned readmission within 30 days. These included four baseline patient characteristics: age 80 years or older [odds ratio = 1.8; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-3.2], previous admission within 30 days (odds ratio = 2.3; 95\% CI, 1.2-4.6), five or more medical comorbidities (odds ratio = 2.6; 95\% CI, 1.5-4.7), and history of depression (odds ratio = 3.2; 95\% CI, 1.4-7.9); and one discharge factor: lack of documented patient or family education (odds ratio = 2.3; 95\% CI, 1.2-4.5). CONCLUSIONS: If validated, these factors may identify patients at high risk of readmission. They suggest that interventions, such as improved discharge education programs, may reduce unplanned readmission.},

Prevalence of multimorbidity in older persons ranges from 55 to 98\%. In cross-sectional studies, older age, female gender, and low socioeconomic status are factors associated with multimorbidity, confirmed by longitudinal studies as well. Major consequences of multimorbidity are disability and functional decline, poor quality of life, and high health care costs. Controversial results were found on multimorbidity and mortality risk. Methodological issues in evaluating multimorbidity are discussed as well as future research needs, especially concerning etiological factors, combinations and clustering of chronic diseases, and care models for persons affected by multiple disorders. New insights in this field can lead to the identification of preventive strategies and better treatment of multimorbid patients.},

METHODS: Existing quality indicators from around the world were mapped to an organizing framework which related primary care, prevention, and health promotion. The indicators were judged against the US Institute of Medicine's assessment criteria of importance and scientific soundness, and only those which met these criteria and were likely to be feasible were included. An initial large set of indicators was reduced by the primary care expert panel using a modified Delphi process. RESULTS: A set of 27 indicators was produced. Six of them were related to health promotion, covering health-related behaviours that are typically targeted by health education and outreach campaigns, 13 to preventive care with a focus on prenatal care and immunizations and eight to primary clinical care mainly addressing activities related to risk reduction. The indicators selected placed a strong emphasis on the public health aspects of primary care. CONCLUSIONS: This project represents an important but preliminary step towards a set of measures to evaluate and compare primary care quality. Further work is required to assess the operational feasibility of the indicators and the validity of any benchmarking data drawn from international comparisons. A conceptual framework needs to be developed that comprehensively captures the complex construct of primary care as a basis for the selection of additional indicators.},

The concern over resistance emergence and spread to people by nontherapeutic use of antimicrobials has led to conflicted practices and opinions. Considerable evidence supported the removal of nontherapeutic antimicrobials (NTAs) in Europe, based on the "precautionary principle." Still, concrete scientific evidence of the favorable versus unfavorable consequences of NTAs is not clear to all stakeholders. Substantial data show elevated antibiotic resistance in bacteria associated with animals fed NTAs and their food products. This resistance spreads to other animals and humans-directly by contact and indirectly via the food chain, water, air, and manured and sludge-fertilized soils. Modern genetic techniques are making advances in deciphering the ecological impact of NTAs, but modeling efforts are thwarted by deficits in key knowledge of microbial and antibiotic loads at each stage of the transmission chain. Still, the substantial and expanding volume of evidence reporting animal-to-human spread of resistant bacteria, including that arising from use of NTAs, supports eliminating NTA use in order to reduce the growing environmental load of resistance genes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients are at increased risk of developing malnutrition-related complications because of physiological changes, suboptimal delivery, and reduced intake. Strategies to improve nutrition during critical illness recovery are required to prevent iatrogenic underfeeding and risk of malnutrition. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a novel family-centered intervention to improve nutrition in critically ill patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 3-phase, prospective cohort feasibility study was conducted in 4 intensive care units (ICUs) across 2 countries. Intervention feasibility was determined by patient eligibility, recruitment, and retention rates. The acceptability of the intervention was assessed by participant perspectives collected through surveys. Participants included family members of the critically ill patients and ICU and ward healthcare professionals (HCPs). RESULTS: A total of 75 patients and family members, as well as 56 HCPs, were enrolled. The consent rate was 66.4\%, and 63 of 75 (84\%) of family participants completed the study. Most family members (53/55; 98.1\%) would recommend the nutrition education program to others and reported improved ability to ask questions about nutrition (16/20; 80.0\%). Family members viewed nutrition care more positively in the ICU. HCPs agreed that families should partner with HCPs to achieve optimal nutrition in the ICU and the wards. Health literacy was identified as a potential barrier to family participation. CONCLUSION: The intervention was feasible and acceptable to families of critically ill patients and HCPs. Further research to evaluate intervention impact on nutrition intake and patient-centered outcomes is required.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: A growing responsibility on the part of individuals to make decisions in health issues implies the need of access to health information and personal skills to comprehend the information. Health literacy comprises skills in obtaining, understanding and acting on information about health issues in ways that promote and maintain health. A lack of health literacy may have effects at both the individual and societal levels. There are thus reasons for health care professionals to gain a comprehensive understanding of health literacy. The aim of this review was to explore how health literacy is described in the scientific literature and to give a synthesis of its different meanings. METHODS: The review was based on approximately 200 scientific articles published 2000-2008. The analysis process was inspired by the methods of narrative literature review. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Two different approaches to health literacy became visible, one in which health literacy is expressed as a polarized phenomenon, focusing on the extremes of low and high health literacy. The definitions of health literacy in this approach are characterized by a functional understanding, pointing out certain basic skills needed to understand health information. The other approach represents a complex understanding of health literacy, acknowledging a broadness of skills in interaction with the social and cultural contexts, which means that an individual's health literacy may fluctuate from one day to another according to the context. The complex approach stresses the interactive and critical skills needed to use information or knowledge as a basis for appropriate health decisions. We conclude that health literacy is a heterogeneous phenomenon that has significance for both the individual and society. Future research will aim at the development of assessments that capture the broadness of skills and agents characteristic for health literacy as a complex phenomenon.},

DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial, parallel 2-group study (intervention and control). SETTING: Primary healthcare centers in Madrid, Spain. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven healthcare centers with 198 healthcare workers (general practitioners, nurses, pediatricians, auxiliary nurses, midwives, odontostomatologists, and dental hygienists). Methods. The multimodal hand hygiene improvement strategy consisted of training of healthcare workers by teaching sessions, implementation of hydroalcoholic solutions, and installation of reminder posters. The hand hygiene compliance level was evaluated by observation during regular care activities in the office visit setting, at the baseline moment, and 6 months after the intervention, all by a single external observer. RESULTS: The overall baseline compliance level was 8.1\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 6.2-10.1), and the healthcare workers of the intervention group increased their hand hygiene compliance level by 21.6\% (95\% CI, 13.83-28.48) compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated that hand hygiene compliance in primary healthcare workers can be improved with a multimodal hand hygiene improvement strategy.},

Readmission rates that are not adjusted for race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status, patient risk factors beyond a hospital's control, may not accurately reflect a hospital's performance. In this study, we examined the extent to which risk-adjusting for race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status affected hospital performance in terms of readmission rates following THA and TKA. Methods: We calculated 2 sets of risk-adjusted readmission rates by (1) using the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services standard risk-adjustment algorithm that incorporates patient age, sex, comorbidities, and hospital effects and (2) adding race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status to the model. Using data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, 2011 State Inpatient Databases, we compared the relative performances of 1,194 hospitals across the 2 methods. Results: Addition of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status to the risk-adjustment algorithm resulted in (1) little or no change in the risk-adjusted readmission rates at nearly all hospitals; (2) no change in the designation of the readmission rate as better, worse, or not different from the population mean at {$>$}99\% of the hospitals; and (3) no change in the excess readmission ratio at {$>$}97\% of the hospitals. Conclusions: Inclusion of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status in the risk-adjustment algorithm led to a relative-performance change in readmission rates following THA and TKA at {$<$}3\% of the hospitals. We believe that policymakers and payers should consider this result when deciding whether to include race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status in risk-adjusted THA and TKA readmission rates used for hospital accountability, payment, and public reporting. Level of Evidence: Prognostic Level III. See instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.},

  abstract = {Whilst exercise is recommended for optimum bone health in adult women, there are few systematic reviews of the efficacy of walking as singular exercise therapy for postmenopausal bone loss. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of prescribed walking programmes on bone mineral density (BMD) at the hip and spine in postmenopausal women and to determine if effects are modified by variations in protocol design. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised (RCTs) and non-randomised controlled trials. Electronic bibliographic databases, key journals and reference lists of reviews and articles were searched to identify studies for inclusion. Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of walking on lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip BMD, measured by radiographic techniques, among sedentary postmenopausal women were eligible for inclusion. Two independent reviewers assessed studies for eligibility. Reported absolute BMD outcomes were combined in the analysis. Weighted mean differences (WMD) were calculated using a fixed and random-effects models. Heterogeneity among trials was examined using the Q statistic and I2 methods. Potential publication bias was assessed through funnel plot inspection. Assessment of trial quality was also performed using the widely used instrument devised by Jadad et al. [Jadad AR, Moore RA, Carroll D, Jenkinson C, Reynolds DJM, Gavaghan DJ, et al. Assessing the quality of reports of randomized clinical trials: Is blinding necessary? Cont Clin Trials 1996; 17:1-12]. Eight trials were eligible for inclusion. Treatment duration ranged from 6 to 24 months. All eight trials reported BMD data at the lumbar spine following walking interventions among postmenopausal women. Meta-analysis showed no significant change in BMD at this site [WMD (fixed-effect) 0.007 g/cm2 95\% CI (-0.001 to 0.016); P=0.09)]. BMD data at the femoral neck were available from five trials among postmenopausal women. Results were inconsistent (I2=51.4\%) in showing a positive effect of walking on BMD at this site [WMD (random-effects) 0.014 g/cm2 95\% CI (0.000 to 0.028); P=0.05). Insufficient data were available for meta-analysis of the total hip site. Funnel plots showed some asymmetry for negative lumbar spine BMD outcomes. Trial quality scores ranged from 0 to 3 from the Jadad scale of 0 to 5. We conclude that regular walking has no significant effect on preservation of BMD at the spine in postmenopausal women, whilst significant positive effects at femoral neck are evident. However, diverse methodological and reporting discrepancies are apparent in the published trials on which these conclusions are based. Other forms of exercise that provide greater targeted skeletal loading may be required to preserve bone mineral density in this population.},

DATA SOURCES: Electronic bibliographic databases, key journals and reference lists of reviews and articles. REVIEW METHODS: Two independent reviewers assessed controlled trials evaluating effects of impact exercise on lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women for inclusion. Heterogeneity amongst trials and publication bias were assessed. Trial quality assessment was also performed. RESULTS: Impact protocols that included jogging mixed with walking and stair climbing, and protocols that incorporated impact exercise with high-magnitude loading (resistance exercises), were effective at lumbar spine (weighted mean difference (random effects) 0.025 g/cm(2) 95\% CI (0.004 to 0.046) and 0.016 g/cm(2) 95\% CI (0.005 to 0.027); p = 0.02 and p = 0.005 respectively), although heterogeneity was evident (I(2) = 88\% and I(2) = 73\%, where I(2) measures the extent of inconsistency among the trials). Effects on femoral neck BMD following these types of protocols were significant (weighted mean difference (fixed effect) 0.022 g/cm(2) 95\% CI (0.014 to 0.030); p{$<$}0.001 and 0.005 g/cm(2) 95\% CI (0.001 to 0.010); p = 0.03 respectively). High-impact only and odd-impact only protocols were ineffective in increasing BMD at any site. CONCLUSION: Mixed loading exercise programmes combining jogging with other low-impact loading activity and programmes mixing impact activity with high-magnitude exercise as resistance training appear effective in reducing postmenopausal bone loss at the hip and spine. Other forms of impact exercise appear less effective at preserving BMD in this population. However, diverse methodological and reporting discrepancies are evident in current published trials.},

METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study of  randomly selected 105 cases and 217 controls in three hospitals in Dodoma region.  Cases were neonates diagnosed with neonatal sepsis. Controls were matched to the  cases by mother's age and parity at a ratio of 1 case to 2 controls. A  semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data on the potential mother,  neonate and interventional predictors of EONS. Both descriptive and inferential  statistical analysis were employed to test for independent association. RESULTS:  Most (92.5\%) of neonates were born at term ({$\geq$}37\,weeks) and 84\% had normal birth  weight of {$\geq$}3 kg. After adjusting for confounders, the maternal factors which  showed significant association with EONS were maternal history of  chorioamnionitis [adjusted odds ratios (AOR)\,=\,1.910, p\,=\,0.042, 95\% confidence  interval (CI): 1.0223.56], HIV status (AOR\,=\,2.909, p\,=\,0.012, 95\% CI:  1.020-8.296), prolonged rupture of membrane (AOR\,=\,2.857, p\,=\,0.014, 95\% CI:  1.233-6.619) and multiple digital vaginal examinations during labor (AOR\,=\,5.178,  p\,=\,0.026, 95\% CI: 1.220-21.986). The neonatal history of perinatal asphyxia was  observed to have a significant association with EONS (AOR\,=\,6.781, p\,=\,0.006, 95\%  CI: 1.725-26.652). CONCLUSION: Both maternal and neonatal predictors had  significant contribution to EONS. Results shed light on critical factors for  consideration to prevent this disease and poor outcomes.},

MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE and Cochrane were systematically searched, as well as grey literature, to identify articles which defined the term polypharmacy (without any limits on the types of definitions) and were in English, published between 1st January 2000 and 30th May 2016. Definitions were categorised as i. numerical only (using the number of medications to define polypharmacy), ii. numerical with an associated duration of therapy or healthcare setting (such as during hospital stay) or iii. Descriptive (using a brief description to define polypharmacy). RESULTS: A total of 1156 articles were identified and 110 articles met the inclusion criteria. Articles not only defined polypharmacy but associated terms such as minor and major polypharmacy. As a result, a total of 138 definitions of polypharmacy and associated terms were obtained. There were 111 numerical only definitions (80.4\% of all definitions), 15 numerical definitions which incorporated a duration of therapy or healthcare setting (10.9\%) and 12 descriptive definitions (8.7\%). The most commonly reported definition of polypharmacy was the numerical definition of five or more medications daily (n = 51, 46.4\% of articles), with definitions ranging from two or more to 11 or more medicines. Only 6.4\% of articles classified the distinction between appropriate and inappropriate polypharmacy, using descriptive definitions to make this distinction. CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy definitions were variable. Numerical definitions of polypharmacy did not account for specific comorbidities present and make it difficult to assess safety and appropriateness of therapy in the clinical setting.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this rapid scoping review, for which only studies from the general population were considered, was to describe the extent of existing research on HL in the context of previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We searched major databases and included publications of quantitative and qualitative studies in English and German on any type of research on the functional, critical and communicative domains of HL conducted in the context of the three outbreaks in the general population. We extracted and tabulated relevant data and narratively reported where and when the study was conducted, the design and method used, and how HL was measured. RESULTS: 72 studies were included. Three investigated HL or explicitly referred to the concept of HL, 14 were guided by health behaviour theory. We did not find any study designed to develop or psychometrically evaluate pandemic/epidemic HL instruments, or relate pandemic/epidemic or general HL to a pandemic/epidemic outcome, or any controlled intervention study. Type of assessment of the domains of HL varied widely. CONCLUSION: Theory-driven observational studies and interventions, examining whether pandemic-related HL can be improved are needed. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The development and validation of instruments that measure pandemic-related HL is desirable.},

  abstract = {It may be premature to think that contemporary families are egalitarian because wives are working more and fathers are more involved with children. This research contends that egalitarianism is reflected in gender similarity in missing work to attend to children's needs. Drawing from two national surveys of dual-earner parents, familial factors (especially children and spouse's work hours) exceeded job-related factors in determining women's sole provision of urgent childcare. Although men's egalitarian ideology was positively associated with urgent-childcare provision, men as a whole were less likely than women to adapt their work efforts to familial demands. These findings suggest more persistent traditionalism than progress toward egalitarianism in work-family role performance. The implications of these results for future research were briefly discussed.}

The rate of hospital readmission (RA) is a potentially important parameter of quality in hospital care. In the present preliminary study, our aim was to measure the rate of readmissions, and to qualify the readmissions as avoidable or not. PRINCIPLES/METHODS: We performed this pilot study at the Department of Internal Medicine (DIM) of the Kantonsspital Winterthur (KSW). Between March 1st. and May 31st 1998 all patients admitted to our hospital were included in the study. Each patient was followed up for a period of 90 days after discharge. RA was classified as planned, unplanned, avoidable or unavoidable. Only the first RA of a patient was investigated. RAs were divided into those occurring within 30 and those occurring within 90 days of discharge. RESULTS: 884 index admissions (IA) were recorded. 83 patients (9.4\%) died and 28 (3.2\%) were referred to another clinic in the KSW. These 111 patients were excluded from the analysis. 773 (87.4\%) patients were discharged from the DIM and are taken as 100\% for the sake of calculation of the rates of RA. 95 (12.3\%) RAs occurred within 30 days, 68 (8.8\%, 95\%-CI 6.8-10.8) of these being RAs related to the IA. 27 (3.5\%) had no relation to the IA. 36 (4.7\%) of these 68 RAs were planned and 32 (4.1\%) were unplanned. Three unplanned RAs (0.4\%) were considered to have been avoidable. When the observation period was extended to 90 days, 151 (19.5\%) RAs occurred. 100 (12.9\%) of the RAs were related to the IA. Of these 100 RAs 46 (5.9\%) were planned and 54 (7.0\%) were unplanned. Of these 54 RAs 10 (1.3\%) were considered to have been avoidable. The highest rate of RAs occurred within the first 10 days of discharge, followed by a substantial decrease in RAs over the next 20 days and a constant low rate over the next 60 days. Unplanned RAs occurred in 59.3\% within the first 30 days. Patients admitted on a Friday had the longest length of stay (LOS) in hospital and those admitted on a Sunday, the shortest. CONCLUSIONS: The present pilot study indicates that RA should be monitored regularly. Most RAs occurred within 30 days of discharge. Extension of the observation period to 90 days did not change the overall conclusions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the decision to seek care and decision-making regarding location of care among parents with low and adequate health literacy. METHODS: Parents of children 8 years old or younger who presented for 'sick child' visits at a clinic or a nonurgent emergency department (ED) visit (triage level 5) were interviewed. The Newest Vital Sign was used to categorize parental health literacy. Interviewers followed a semistructured interview guide to understand: 1) care-seeking for current illness, and 2) choice of clinic or ED. Themes emerged using a grounded theory process, facilitated by NVivo version 10.0 software (QSR International, Melbourne, Australia). Themes included the experiences of low and adequate health literacy in the clinic as well as in the ED. RESULTS: Fifty semistructured interviews were completed with parents who brought their child to the ED for a nonurgent visit (n~=~30) and clinic parents (n~=~20) with 56\% possessing low health literacy. Parents with low health literacy were more inclined to overestimate severity of illness and seek care sooner to gain answers about the illness and treatment options, and visit the clinic only when an appointment was available within hours. Parents with adequate health literacy sought reassurance for their ongoing illness management and valued close relationships with their physician, and were willing to wait longer for an appointment. Fever, vomiting, and young child age prompted some parents to seek expedient care regardless of health literacy. CONCLUSIONS: Caregiving skills (eg, assessing and treating illness, understanding illness severity, and navigating the health care system) in addition to physician-parent relationships and perception of care seem to influence the behavior of parents managing their child's mild acute illness. These factors might be amenable to a future health literacy intervention.},

Given the role of family members in helping patients with limited health literacy, patients' health literacy status may moderate these relations. The authors tested this hypothesis with 192 adults with type 2 diabetes. Twenty-six percent had limited health literacy, and limited health literacy was associated with more supportive family behaviors (p{$<$}.05), but not with obstructive family behaviors or with patients' HbA1C. Adjusted stratified analyses indicated obstructive family behaviors were more strongly associated with worse HbA1C among participants with limited health literacy and low supportive family behaviors than for participants with adequate health literacy and low supportive family behaviors (adjusted simple slopes {$\beta$}=0.70, p=.05 vs. {$\beta$}=0.36, p=.009). However, there was no association between obstructive family behaviors and HbA1C in the context of high supportive family behaviors, regardless of health literacy status. Involving family members in adults' self-care without teaching them to avoid obstructive behaviors may be particularly harmful for patients with limited health literacy. Future research should identify intervention content to reduce obstructive family behaviors and identify which supportive family behaviors may be protective.},

To inform strategies to assist providers in communicating in a manner that is easily understood by patients, it would be beneficial to determine the relationship between health literacy and the day-to-day aspects of medication adherence. This study identified: 1) differences of health literacy levels in medication adherence; 2) the association between health literacy and medication adherence; and 3) and factors associated with medication adherence score. A convenience sample of older predominantly African-American patients (N~=~389), over the age of 60, completed a cross-sectional survey. Chi-square analysis assessed health literacy differences in five aspects of medication adherence. Ordinary linear regression analysis determined factors associated with medication adherence score. Patients with limited health literacy were more likely to forget to take their medications and more likely to take less medication than instructed than patients with adequate health literacy ({$\chi$}(2)(5) = 15.91, p = .007, {$\chi$}(2)(5) = 10.31, p = .036, respectively). REALM score was also significantly associated with medication adherence score ({$\beta$}= .016, p {$<$} .001, {$\beta$} = .009, p = .033), respectively). Findings suggest that providers seeking to improve medication adherence in older adults, particularly African-American patients, should focus communication on assessing health literacy levels prior to discussing medication instructions.},

Antibiotic misuse leads to antibiotic resistance. This study assessed knowledge of appropriate antibiotic use among buyers in the Moshi municipality, Northern Tanzania. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in Moshi municipality between April and May 2017. Adults who bought antibiotics at drug outlets were invited to participate in the study. An exit interview was conducted with participants to collect their demographics and assess their knowledge concerning appropriate use of antibiotics. A logistic regression model was performed to determine factors associated with correct knowledge concerning antibiotic use. RESULTS: A total of 152 adults with a median age of 30.5 (IQR 25-42) years, were enrolled in the study. Slightly over half (n = 89, 58.6\%), responded that they should stop antibiotics after finishing the dose as directed. Half (n = 77, 50.7\%) thought that it was acceptable to share antibiotics with other individuals and over half of respondents (n = 95, 65.1\%) thought that they should request the same antibiotics if they had used them to treat a similar illness in the past. Only 38 (25\%) had adequate knowledge about the use of antibiotics. Sore throat and flu were respectively identified by 62.5\% and 46.1\% of respondents as conditions that can be treated with antibiotics. Higher levels of education (aOR = 4.11 95\%CI = 1.44-11.71) and having health insurance (aOR = 9.05 95\%CI = 3.35-24.45) were associated with better levels of knowledge concerning antibiotic use in various illnesses. CONCLUSION: There is inadequate knowledge concerning the indications for antibiotics and their appropriate usage. Health promotion campaigns are needed to educate the population about appropriate antibiotic use and reduce their irrational use.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coproduced epilepsy care sees people with epilepsy (PwE), their care-proxies, and healthcare providers (HCPs), working together as partners to build strong relationships, improve communication, trust, and share decision-making. Coproduction underpins good quality patient- and family-centered care (PFCC) that is responsive to individual patient needs, preferences, and values. By facilitating information sharing and exchange between partners, electronic patient portals (ePortal) can enable coproduction. This paper explores what HCPs, PwE, and their care-proxies value from their user experience of PiSCES, the Irish epilepsy ePortal. METHODS: A purposeful sample of actors involved in the receipt and delivery of epilepsy care and services were recruited via adult epilepsy centers at St James's and Beaumont Hospitals in Dublin. Interactive codesign sessions, surveys, and focus groups were used to elicit perspectives from PwE, care-proxies, and HCPs to understand their perception of how PiSCES could enhance or inhibit the epilepsy care process. RESULTS: Results illustrate that participants welcome the role PiSCES can play in: empowering PwE/care-proxies, strengthening confidence in the healthcare system; aiding memory; advancing health literacy, motivating PwE to understand their condition better; acting as a passport of care between different clinical settings; and creating a foundation for stronger coproduction partnerships. PiSCES was generally embraced; however, some HCPs expressed plausible concerns about how clinical implementation might impact their work practices. CONCLUSION: "Nothing about me without me" is a core value of the PiSCES initiative, recognizing that people need to be included in the planning of their own treatment and care. Our data show that PwE, their care-proxies, and HCPs value PiSCES potential, particularly in bolstering healthcare partnerships that foster inclusion, confidence, and trust.},

  abstract = {``Pseudo-endocrine disorders'' refer to proposed conditions that have never been scientifically proven to exist but, due to widespread misinformation available on the internet and other media, are relatively commonly diagnosed and treated with equally unproven and sometimes dangerous treatments. Adrenal fatigue is a nonexistent condition that supposedly results from adrenal exhaustion and atrophy due to chronic stress and has been promoted as a potential explanation for a variety of symptoms. Testing consists of nonvalidated online surveys and salivary cortisol profiles while treatment is not evidence-based at best and can be dangerous. Wilson's syndrome and reverse T3 syndrome are also nonexistent conditions that supposedly result from impaired T4 to T3 conversion and competition of excess reverse T3 with T3 for T3 receptors. Testing involves measurement of axillary temperature and treatment consists of T3 therapy, often at very high and dangerous doses. Hypogonadism (``low T'') is frequently diagnosed in ``men's health'' clinics and other venues without actual hormone testing or further evaluation and is often treated with supraphysiologic testosterone therapy that suppresses endogenous gonadal testosterone and sperm production, leads to a lifelong need for testosterone therapy, and may have numerous other harmful effects. Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) therapy has been proposed as a treatment for multiple disorders including autoimmune conditions and other disorders resulting from aberrant immune mechanisms, but there is no valid evidence that LDN has any benefits. Management of patients with pseudo-endocrine disorders must involve careful listening, patient education, healthy lifestyle measures, and honesty, encouragement, and compassion.},

Most of these active agents demonstrate broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity; however, little is known about the mode of action of these agents in comparison to antibiotics. This review considers what is known about the mode of action and spectrum of activity of antiseptics and disinfectants. The widespread use of these products has prompted some speculation on the development of microbial resistance, in particular whether antibiotic resistance is induced by antiseptics or disinfectants. Known mechanisms of microbial resistance (both intrinsic and acquired) to biocides are reviewed, with emphasis on the clinical implications of these reports.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Provisions of the Affordable Care Act that increase hospitals' financial accountability for preventable readmissions have heightened interest in identifying system-level interventions to reduce readmissions. OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between hospital nursing; that is, nurse work environment, nurse staffing levels, and nurse education, and 30-day readmissions among Medicare patients with heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and pneumonia. METHOD AND DESIGN: Analysis of linked data from California, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania that included information on the organization of hospital nursing (ie, work environment, patient-to-nurse ratios, and proportion of nurses holding a BSN degree) from a survey of nurses, as well as patient discharge data, and American Hospital Association Annual Survey data. Robust logistic regression was used to estimate the relationship between nursing factors and 30-day readmission. RESULTS: Nearly 1 quarter of heart failure index admissions [23.3\% (n=39,954)], 19.1\% (n=12,131) of myocardial infarction admissions, and 17.8\% (n=25,169) of pneumonia admissions were readmitted within 30 days. Each additional patient per nurse in the average nurse's workload was associated with a 7\% higher odds of readmission for heart failure [odds ratio (OR)=1.07; confidence interval CI, 1.05-1.09], 6\% for pneumonia patients (OR=1.06; CI, 1.03-1.09), and 9\% for myocardial infarction patients (OR=1.09; CI, 1.05-1.13). Care in a hospital with a good versus poor work environment was associated with odds of readmission that were 7\% lower for heart failure (OR=0.93; CI, 0.89-0.97), 6\% lower for myocardial infarction (OR=0.94; CI, 0.88-0.98), and 10\% lower for pneumonia (OR=0.90; CI, 0.85-0.96) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Improving nurses' work environments and staffing may be effective interventions for preventing readmissions.},

Our objective was to estimate the effect of overweight and obesity on the use and cost of allied health services among middle-aged and older people. METHODS: the study used data from The Irish Longitudinal Study of Ageing (TILDA), a nationally representative study of adults aged {$>$}/=50 sampled using multistage stratified clustered sampling, which included objective measures of height and weight. Body mass index was categorised as normal (18.5-24.99 kg/m(2)), overweight (25.00-29.99 kg/m(2)), moderate obesity (30.00-34.99 kg/m(2)), severe obesity (35.00-39.99 kg/m(2)) or morbid obesity ({$>$}/=40 kg/m(2)). Participants were asked about a range of allied health services including dietetic services, public health nurse visits, chiropody and home help. Adjusted seemingly unrelated biprobit models were used to account for unobserved heterogeneity associated with the use of services. RESULTS: among 5,841 participants, 77.6\% (95\% CI = 76-79\%) were overweight or obese (n = 4,534). All classes of obesity were significantly associated with higher general practitioner service use (P {$<$} 0.05). Moderate and severe obesity were associated with increased use of out-patient services, while only moderate obesity was associated with increased hospital admissions (P {$<$} 0.05). Moderate and severe obesity were significantly associated with chiropody service use (P {$<$} 0.05) with an estimated annual cost of euro919,662. Morbid obesity was associated with dietetic service use (P {$<$} 0.001) with an annual cost of euro580,013. CONCLUSION: given these costs and improvements in life expectancy, an increasingly obese older population presents new challenges for healthcare delivery.},

Diverse research databases (including CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE, and Social Science Abstracts) were comprehensively searched during the years 1988-2004 inclusive, using "obesity," "socioeconomic status," and synonyms as search terms. A total of 333 published studies, representing 1,914 primarily cross-sectional associations, were included in the review. The overall pattern of results, for both men and women, was of an increasing proportion of positive associations and a decreasing proportion of negative associations as one moved from countries with high levels of socioeconomic development to countries with medium and low levels of development. Findings varied by SES indicator; for example, negative associations (lower SES associated with larger body size) for women in highly developed countries were most common with education and occupation, while positive associations for women in medium- and low-development countries were most common with income and material possessions. Patterns for women in higher- versus lower-development countries were generally less striking than those observed by Sobal and Stunkard; this finding is interpreted in light of trends related to globalization. Results underscore a view of obesity as a social phenomenon, for which appropriate action includes targeting both economic and sociocultural factors.},

SETTING: Academic medical centres across Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two specialists selected arbitrarily, including 7 clinical pharmacologists, 9 geriatricians, 8 family practitioners and 8 pharmacists. OUTCOME MEASURES: Consensus that the practice would introduce a substantial and significant increase in the risk of serious adverse effect and is common enough that its curtailment would decrease morbidity among elderly people, ranking of clinical importance of the risk, and availability of equally or more effective and less risky alternative therapy. RESULTS: The 32-member national panel developed a list of 71 practices in prescribing for elderly people and rated the clinical significance of each on a scale of 1 (not significant) to 4 (highly significant). The practices in prescribing identified fell into 3 categories: drugs generally contraindicated for elderly people, drug-disease interactions and drug-drug interactions. The mean significance rating was greater than 3 for 39 practices. For each practice, alternative therapies were recommended. There was surprising congruence among the specialists on the significance rating and the suggested alternative therapies. CONCLUSION: The authors have developed a valid, relevant list of inappropriate practices in prescribing for elderly people, to be used in a practice-based intervention study.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: More than 25\% of Medicare patients hospitalized for heart failure are readmitted within 30 days. The contributions of numeracy and health literacy to recidivism for patients with acute heart failure (AHF) are not known. METHODS AND RESULTS: A cohort of patients with acute heart failure who presented to 4 emergency departments between January 2008 and September 2011. Research assistants administered subjective measures of numeracy and health literacy; 30-day follow-up was performed by phone interview. Recidivism was defined as any unplanned return to the emergency department or hospital within 30 days of the index emergency department visit for AHF. Multivariable logistic regression adjusting for patient age, sex, race, insurance status, hospital site, days eligible for recidivism, chronic kidney disease, abnormal hemoglobin, and low ejection fraction evaluated the relation between numeracy and health literacy with 30-day recidivism. Of the 709 patients included in the analysis, 390 (55\%) had low numeracy skills and 258 (37\%) had low literacy skills. Low numeracy was associated with increased odds of recidivism within 30 days (adjusted odds ratio, 1.41; 95\% confidence interval, 1.00-1.98; P=0.048). For low health literacy, adjusted odds ratio of recidivism was 1.17 (95\% confidence interval, 0.83-1.65; P=0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Low numeracy was associated with greater odds of 30-day recidivism. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether addressing numeracy and health literacy may reduce 30-day recidivism for patients with acute heart failure.},

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the relationship between low health literacy and elevated blood pressure (BP) at hospital presentation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We conducted a cross-sectional evaluation of adult patients hospitalized at a university hospital between November 1, 2010 and April 30, 2012. MEASURES: Health literacy was assessed using the Brief Health Literacy Screen (BHLS). Low health literacy was defined as a BHLS score {$\leq$}9. BP was assessed using clinical measurements. The outcome was elevated BP ({$\geq$}140/90 mm Hg; {$\geq$}130/80 mm Hg with diabetes or renal disease) or extremely elevated BP ({$>$}160/100 mm Hg) at hospital presentation. Multivariate logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, race, insurance, comorbidities, and antihypertensive medications; preplanned restricted analysis among patients with diagnosed hypertension was performed. RESULTS: Of 46,263 hospitalizations, 23\% had low health literacy, which occurred more often among patients who were older (61 vs. 54 y), less educated (28.4\% vs. 11.2\% had not completed high school), and more often admitted through the emergency department (54.3\% vs. 48.1\%) than those with BHLS{$>$}9. Elevated BP was more frequent among those with low health literacy [40.0\% vs. 35.5\%; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.06; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.12]. Low health literacy was associated with extremely elevated BP (aOR 1.08; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.16) and elevated BP among those without diagnosed hypertension (aOR 1.09; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.16). CONCLUSIONS: More than {$\frac{1}{3}$} of patients had elevated BP at hospital presentation. Low health literacy was independently associated with elevated BP, particularly among patients without diagnosed hypertension.},

Lower health literacy is associated with mortality among outpatients with chronic heart failure; little is known about this relationship after hospitalization for acute heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients hospitalized for acute heart failure and discharged home between November 2010 and June 2013 were followed through December 31, 2013. Nurses administered the Brief Health Literacy Screen at admission; low health literacy was defined as Brief Health Literacy Screen {$<$}/=9. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were time to first rehospitalization and, separately, time to first emergency department visit within 90 days of discharge. Cox proportional hazards models determined their relationships with health literacy, adjusting for age, gender, race, insurance, education, comorbidity, and hospital length of stay. For the 1379 patients, average age was 63.1 years, 566 (41.0\%) were female, and 324 (23.5\%) had low health literacy. Median follow-up was 20.7 months (interquartile range 12.8 to 29.6 months), and 403 (29.2\%) patients died. Adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] for death among patients with LHL was 1.32 (95\%confidence interval [CI] 1.05, 1.66, P=0.02) compared to BHLS{$>$}9 [corrected].Within 90 days of discharge, there were 415 (30.1\%) rehospitalizations and 201 (14.6\%) emergency department visits, with no evident association with health literacy. CONCLUSIONS: Lower health literacy was associated with increased risk of death after hospitalization for acute heart failure. There was no evident relationship between health literacy and 90-day rehospitalization or emergency department visits.},

We randomly selected urban and rural high and low testing practices served by Bristol, Hereford, and Gloucester microbiology laboratories. Open questions were asked about the investigation of C trachomatis in men and women in different clinical contexts. RESULTS The high and low testing practices did not differ in their age/sex make-up or by deprivation indices. There were major differences between high and low chlamydia testing practices. Low testing practices knew very little about the epidemiology and presentation of genital chlamydia infection and did not consider it in their differential diagnosis of genitourinary symptoms until patients had consulted several times. Low testers were less aware that chlamydia was usually asymptomatic, thought it was an inner city problem, and had poor knowledge of how to take diagnostic specimens. High testing practices either had a general practitioner with an interest in sexual health or a practice nurse who had completed specialist training in family planning. High testing practices were more cognizant of the symptoms and signs of chlamydia and always considered it in their differential diagnosis of genitourinary symptoms, including patients attending family planning clinics. CONCLUSIONS Any programme to increase chlamydia testing in primary care must be accompanied by an education and awareness programme especially targeted at low testing practices. This will need to include information about the benefits of testing and who, when, and how to test.}

The large Department of Health sponsored household survey demonstrated that those with a greater knowledge about antibiotics were no less likely to be prescribed an antibiotic, and although those with increased knowledge about antibiotics were more likely to complete a course they were also more likely to self-medicate and to keep left-over antibiotics. Future campaigns that are aimed at reducing the level of prescribing should be focused towards those more likely to be prescribed antibiotics at present: younger women and those with a lower level of education. They should also examine and consider modifying consultation behaviour and other behavioural components involved in patient' expectations for antibiotics. This should include delayed antibiotic prescriptions. The easiest way to reduce the use of leftovers may be to shorten the course of antibiotics prescribed to 3 or 5 days. We should also promote a 'Do not recycle antibiotics' message towards the more highly educated, young women who are more likely to store, take and share antibiotics without advice.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Changing public awareness of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a global public health priority. A systematic review of interventions that targeted public AMR awareness and associated behaviour was previously conducted. Here, we focus on identifying the active content of these interventions and explore potential mechanisms of action. METHODS: The project took a novel approach to intervention mapping utilizing the following steps: (1) an exploration of explicit and tacit theory and theoretical constructs within the interventions using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDFv2), (2) retrospective coding of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) using the BCT Taxonomy v1, and (3) an investigation of coherent links between the TDF domains and BCTs across the interventions. RESULTS: Of 20 studies included, only four reported an explicit theoretical basis to their intervention. However, TDF analysis revealed that nine of the 14 TDF domains were utilized, most commonly 'Knowledge' and 'Environmental context and resources'. The BCT analysis showed that all interventions contained at least one BCT, and 14 of 93 (15\%) BCTs were coded, most commonly 'Information about health consequences', 'Credible source', and 'Instruction on how to perform the behaviour'. CONCLUSIONS: We identified nine relevant TDF domains and 14 BCTs used in these interventions. Only 15\% of BCTs have been applied in AMR interventions thus providing a clear opportunity for the development of novel interventions in this context. This methodological approach provides a useful way of retrospectively mapping theoretical constructs and BCTs when reviewing studies that provide limited information on theory and intervention content. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Evidence of the effectiveness of interventions that target the public to engage them with AMR is mixed; the public continue to show poor knowledge and misperceptions of AMR. Little is known about the common, active ingredients of AMR interventions targeting the public and information on explicit theoretical content is sparse. Information on the components of AMR public health interventions is urgently needed to enable the design of effective interventions to engage the public with AMR stewardship behaviour. What does this study add? The analysis shows very few studies reported any explicit theoretical basis to the interventions they described. Many interventions share common components, including core mechanisms of action and behaviour change techniques. The analysis suggests components of future interventions to engage the public with AMR.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) causes invasive infections in neonates and has been implicated as a cause of prelabour rupture of membranes, preterm  delivery and stillbirths. The success of phase II trials of polyvalent  polysaccharide GBS vaccines indicates that these infections are potentially  preventable. Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with one of the  highest birth rates, one of the highest neonatal sepsis incidence rates and one  of the highest mortality rates in the world. Therefore, before the possible  introduction of preventive strategies such as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis  or GBS vaccine into Nigeria, it is vital that there is accurate data on the  aetiology of neonatal sepsis and on the incidence of GBS neonatal sepsis in  particular. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence and  aetiology of neonatal sepsis in Nigeria with a focus on GBS sepsis and also to  assess the potential impact of a GBS vaccine. METHODS: A literature search was  conducted on the databases of African journals online, PubMed and Google Scholar  for works conducted between 1987 to 2017. Case reports, reviews, and studies not  stating specific culture methods or specific bacteria isolated were excluded.  Data extracted included; incidence of neonatal sepsis, method of blood culture,  blood volume, sample size, bacterial agents isolated and history of antibiotic  use. PRISMA guidelines were followed and modified Down's and Black criteria used  to evaluate the quality of studies. RESULTS: A total of 5,114 studies were  reviewed for neonatal sepsis out of which 24 consisting of a total of 2,280 cases  were selected for final review. Nine studies met criteria for assessment of  hospital based incidence of neonatal sepsis representing 31,305 hospital births.  The incidence of neonatal sepsis was 18.2/1000 livebirths with range from  7-55/1000 livebirths while the GBS incidence was 0.06/1000 livebirths with range  from 0-2/1000 live births. We discovered various limitations such as  identification techniques that could result in underestimation of the true  incidence of GBS sepsis. Pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and  Staphylococcus aureus were more commonly isolated than GBS. IMPLICATIONS OF KEY  FINDINGS: The hospital based incidence of neonatal sepsis was high at 18.2/1000  live births while that due to GBS was 0.06/1000 live births. The burden of  neonatal sepsis, including that attributable to GBS is substantial and could be  reduced by preventive strategies such as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis or  GBS vaccine. There is however very sparse meaningful data currently. Well planned  prospective studies with larger sample sizes, more advanced isolation and  identification techniques and those following up invasive disease cases for  possible short and long term sequelae are needed-not only prior to possible  introduction of the vaccine to determine the baseline epidemiology, but also  thereafter to monitor its impact on the population. Strategies need to be  developed to also reduce the morbidity and mortality attributable to other  bacteria that have an incidence even greater than that of GBS.},

METHODS: Multistage stratified random sampling was used to select 5304 urban and rural residents aged 15 to 69\,years from 204 monitoring points in 15 districts of Wuhan. Using the Chinese Citizen Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) (2018 edition), a face-to-face survey was conducted from November to December 2018. Risk factors that may affect health literacy were assessed using the Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: The knowledge rate of health literacy was relatively low (19.3\%). The knowledge rate of health-related behaviour and lifestyle (BAL, 17.3\%) was the lowest of the three aspects of health literacy, and the knowledge rate of chronic diseases (CD, 19.0\%) was the lowest of the six dimensions of health literacy. Respondents who lived in urban areas, had higher education levels, worked as medical staff, had a higher household income and did not suffer from chronic diseases were likely to have higher health literacy. CONCLUSIONS: The health literacy levels of citizens in Wuhan are insufficient and need to improve.},

SUBJECTS: A nationally representative Swedish sample of 1207 women and 1326 men aged 18-64 years. RESULTS: Univariately most of these socio-demographic variables were associated with several of the LiSat-11 items. Using logistic regression, perceived good health and not being a first generation immigrant were the most prominent positive predictors of satisfaction with life as a whole and of most of the domains. Also educational level impacted predictively on satisfaction with many LiSat-11 items. Furthermore, those who were vocationally active, perceived their financial situation as better than or similar to most people's and had a steady partner relationship were particularly likely to be satisfied with life as a whole and with two or more of the domains. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that a multitude of aspects must be taken into account when assessing life satisfaction.},

Prevalence surveys have a long tradition in the field of infection prevention and control for measuring both HAI and antimicrobial use. The objective of this survey was to test the point prevalence survey (PPS) methodology of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in acute-care hospitals in Switzerland. METHODS: Two tertiary care hospitals and one secondary care hospital in central and western Switzerland participated in the survey. Patients from all wards except for emergency departments and psychiatric wards were included. Data were collected on a single day for every ward with a maximum time frame of 2 weeks for completing data collection. Methodology and definitions were based on the most recent ECDC PPS protocol. RESULTS: Data on a total of 2421 patients were analysed. One hundred thirty-six patients had 153 HAIs, corresponding to a prevalence of 5.6\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 4.7-6.5\%). Rapidly fatal McCabe score, hospitalisation in the intensive care unit (ICU), and having a medical device in place were independent risk factors for HAI. Lower respiratory tract infection was the most frequent HAI type (24.8\%), followed by surgical site infection (22.2\%), bloodstream infection (17.0\%) and urinary tract infection (13.7\%). The highest HAI prevalence (26.2\%) was observed in the ICU. In total, 60.8\% of all HAIs were microbiologically confirmed. The most common microorganism was Escherichia coli (21.1\%). Six hundred sixty-nine patients (27.6\%, 95\% CI 25.9-29.4\%) received 893 antimicrobials for 705 indications. Community-acquired infections (39.0\%) were the most common indication for antimicrobial use and amoxicillin-clavulanate was the most commonly prescribed antimicrobial (18.4\%). CONCLUSIONS: HAI prevalence and antimicrobial use in this survey were similar to findings of the past ECDC PPS. The ECDC methodology proved applicable to Swiss acute-care hospitals.},

Methods: Functional status was documented by the Barthel index (BI), Tinetti test (TBGT), and timed up and go test (TUG) prior to and after CGC. The results were analyzed in relation to hypertensive BP, indicated by mean BP {$\geq$} 130/80 mmHg determined by 24 h blood pressure monitoring (BPM) while hospitalized. Results: In the presented monocentric, retrospective, observational study, 490 patients were included (mean age (SD): 83.86 {\textpm} 6.17 years, 72.2\% females). Hypertension in BPM was found in 302 (61.6\%) individuals. Hypertensive BP was associated with the female sex (p {$<$} 0.001) and current fracture (p = 0.001), and inversely associated with heart failure (p {$<$} 0.001), coronary heart disease (p {$<$} 0.001), atrial fibrillation (p {$<$} 0.001), urinary tract infection (p = 0.022), and hypocalcemia (p = 0.014). After CGC, improvements in BI (p {$<$} 0.001), TBGT (p {$<$} 0.001), and TUG (p {$<$} 0.001) were observed in patients with both normotensive and hypertensive BP profiles. The proportion of patients with outcome improvements did not differ between the two groups (BI: 84.4\% vs. 88.3\%, p = 0.285; TBGT: 81.1\% vs. 77.7\%, p = 0.357; TUG: 50.3\% vs. 48.4\%, p = 0.711). Conclusion: Patients both with and without hypertensive BP profiles benefited from comprehensive geriatric care with comparable outcome improvements. Particularly, normotensive BP was associated with chronic cardiovascular comorbidities, indicating increased awareness of the importance of BP management in patients diagnosed with cardiac diseases.},

We examined age-related differences and similarities in memory for health-related information under conditions where some information was critical to remember. METHOD: In Experiment 1, participants studied 3 lists of allergens, ranging in severity from 0 (not a health risk) to 10 (potentially fatal), with the instruction that it was particularly important to remember items to which a fictional relative was most severely allergic. After each list, participants received feedback regarding their recall of the high-value allergens. Experiment 2 examined memory for health benefits, presenting foods that were potentially beneficial to the relative's immune system. RESULTS: While younger adults exhibited better overall memory for the allergens, both age groups in Experiment 1 developed improved selectivity across the lists, with no evident age differences in severe allergen recall by List 2. Selectivity also developed in Experiment 2, although age differences for items of high health benefit were present. DISCUSSION: The results have implications for models of selective memory in older age, and for how aging influences the ability to strategically remember important information within health-related contexts.},

We described  trends and spatial distribution of neonatal sepsis in Uganda, 2016-2020. METHODS:  We conducted a descriptive incidence study using routinely-reported surveillance  data on in-patient neonatal sepsis from the District Health Information System  version 2 (DHIS2) during 2016-2020. We calculated incidence of EOS, LOS, and  total sepsis as cases per 1,000 live births (LB) at district (n\,=\,136), regional  (n\,=\,4), and national levels, as well as total sepsis incidence by health  facility level. We used logistic regression to evaluate national and regional  trends and illustrated spatial distribution using choropleth maps. RESULTS:  During 2016-2020, 95,983 neonatal sepsis cases were reported, of which 71,262  (74\%) were EOS. Overall neonatal sepsis incidence was 17.4/1,000 LB. EOS  increased from 11.7 to 13.4 cases/1,000 LB with an average yearly increase of 3\%  (p\,{$<$}\,0.001); LOS declined from 5.7 to 4.3 cases/1,000 LB with an average yearly  decrease of 7\% (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Incidence was highest at referral hospitals (68/1,000  LB) and lowest at Health Center IIs (1.3/1,000 LB). Regionally, total sepsis  increased in Central (15.5 to 23.0/1,000 LB, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and Northern regions  (15.3 to 22.2/1,000 LB, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) but decreased in Western (23.7 to 17.0/ 1,000  LB, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and Eastern (15.0 to 8.9/1,000, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) regions. CONCLUSION:  The high and increasing incidence of EOS in Uganda suggests a major gap in sepsis  prevention and quality of care for pregnant women. The heterogenous distribution  of neonatal sepsis incidence requires root cause analysis by health authorities  in regions with consistently high incidence. Strengthening prevention and  treatment interventions in Central and Northern regions, and in the most affected  districts, could reduce neonatal sepsis. Employment of strategies which increase  uptake of safe newborn care practices and prevent neonatal sepsis, such as  community health worker (CHW) home visits for mothers and newborns, could reduce  incidence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The true prevalence of healthy ageing on a population level is unknown. In this study we aimed to examine the upper limit for the prevalence of healthy ageing, by quantifying the probability of surviving and remaining free of chronic diseases that could impact functioning (ie, healthy survival) across adulthood. We also estimated the prevalence of clinically assessed healthy ageing, and the determinants of healthy survival and healthy ageing. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, we assessed men and women born in 1934-44 from the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study (Helsinki, Finland; n=13\hphantom{,}140). We obtained information on chronic diseases, deaths, and early-to-midlife variables from national registers, databases, and health records for the period Jan 1, 1971, to Dec 31, 2017 (follow-up 951\hphantom{,}088 person-years). We also collated data from clinical visits conducted in 2001-04 and 2017-18. Healthy ageing was defined on the basis of clinical data according to six criteria covering chronic diseases, cognitive function, physical performance, depressive symptoms, pain interference, and social functioning. We analysed the probability of healthy survival across adulthood using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the determinants of healthy survival using Cox regression models. We assessed the association of healthy ageing status in 2017-18 (n=813 with available data) with late-midlife factors collected in 2001-04 using age-adjusted logistic regression. FINDINGS: The probability of healthy survival was 42{$\cdot$}8\% (95\% CI 41{$\cdot$}6-44{$\cdot$}0) in men and 40{$\cdot$}1\% (38{$\cdot$}9-41{$\cdot$}4) in women at age 65 years, and 22{$\cdot$}5\% (21{$\cdot$}5-23{$\cdot$}6\%) in men and 24{$\cdot$}4\% (23{$\cdot$}3-25{$\cdot$}6) in women at age 75 years. Healthy survival was associated with socioeconomic position in childhood (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], upper-middle class vs manual worker, men: 1{$\cdot$}21 [1{$\cdot$}11-1{$\cdot$}31]; women: 1{$\cdot$}15 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}05-1{$\cdot$}26]) and years of education (aHR per 1 SD increase, men: 1{$\cdot$}12 [1{$\cdot$}08-1{$\cdot$}16]; women: 1{$\cdot$}03 [1{$\cdot$}00-1{$\cdot$}07]). In men, healthy survival was also associated with lower maternal BMI in late pregnancy (aHR per 1 SD increase 0{$\cdot$}93 [0{$\cdot$}90-0{$\cdot$}96]), and in women, with shorter height at age 7 years (aHR per 1 SD increase 0{$\cdot$}95 [0{$\cdot$}91-0{$\cdot$}99]). Among the 813 individuals with relevant clinical assessment data, 159 (19{$\cdot$}6\%) met all six criteria for healthy ageing at mean age 76 years (SD 3). In addition to age, we found that nutrition (Alternative Healthy Eating Index, age-adjusted odds ratio [aOR] per 1 point increase 1{$\cdot$}03 [1{$\cdot$}01-1{$\cdot$}05]), former smoker status (vs non-smoker status, aOR 0{$\cdot$}68 [0{$\cdot$}47-0{$\cdot$}98], and use of lipid-lowering medication (vs not used, aOR 0{$\cdot$}60 [0{$\cdot$}42-0{$\cdot$}87]) in late midlife (mean age 61 years [SD 3]) were associated with healthy ageing. INTERPRETATION: The probability of healthy survival, as the upper limit for healthy ageing, was less than 50\% from age 65 years. The probability of healthy survival and healthy ageing was influenced by several factors across the life course. Promotion of healthy ageing needs to take a life course approach.

  abstract = {Reliable quantitative ratings of chronic medical illness burden have proved to be difficult in geropsychiatric practice and research. Thus, the purpose of the study was to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of a modified version of the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS; Linn et al., 1968) in providing quantitative ratings of chronic illness burden. The modified CIRS was operationalized with a manual of guidelines geared toward the geriatric patient and for clarity was designated the CIRS(G). A total of 141 elderly outpatient subjects (two medical clinic groups of 20 each, 45 recurrent depressed subjects, 21 spousally bereaved subjects, and 35 healthy controls) received comprehensive physical examinations, reviews of symptoms, and laboratory testing. These data were then used by nurse practitioners, physician's assistants, and geriatric psychiatrists to compute CIRS(G) ratings of chronic illness burden. As hypothesized, analysis of variance demonstrated significant differences among groups with respect to total medical illness burden, which was highest among medical clinic patients and lowest in control subjects. Good interrater reliability (i.e., intraclass correlations of 0.78 and 0.88 in a subsample of 10 outpatients and a separate group of 10 inpatients, respectively) was achieved for CIRS(G) total scores. Among medical clinic patients, a significant correlation was found, as expected, between CIRS(G) chronic illness burden and capability as quantified by the Older Americans Activities of Daily Living Scale; and between CIRS(G) scores and physicians' global estimates of medical burden. Finally, with repeated measures of illness burden approximately 1 year from symptom baseline, significant rises were detected, as expected. The current data suggest that the CIRS(G) can be successfully applied in medically and psychiatrically impaired elderly subjects, with good interrater reliability and face validity (credibility).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a primary cause of neonatal mortality and is an urgent global health concern, especially within low-income and middle-income  countries (LMICs), where 99\% of global neonatal mortality occurs. The aims of  this study were to determine the incidence and associations with neonatal sepsis  and all-cause mortality in facility-born neonates in LMICs. METHODS: The Burden  of Antibiotic Resistance in Neonates from Developing Societies (BARNARDS) study  recruited mothers and their neonates into a prospective observational cohort  study across 12 clinical sites from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan,  Nigeria, Rwanda, and South Africa. Data for sepsis-associated factors in the four  domains of health care, maternal, birth and neonatal, and living environment were  collected for all mothers and neonates enrolled. Primary outcomes were clinically  suspected sepsis, laboratory-confirmed sepsis, and all-cause mortality in  neonates during the first 60 days of life. Incidence proportion of livebirths for  clinically suspected sepsis and laboratory-confirmed sepsis and incidence rate  per 1000 neonate-days for all-cause mortality were calculated. Modified Poisson  regression was used to investigate factors associated with neonatal sepsis and  parametric survival models for factors associated with all-cause mortality.  FINDINGS: Between Nov 12, 2015 and Feb 1, 2018, 29\hphantom{,}483 mothers and 30\hphantom{,}557  neonates were enrolled. The incidence of clinically suspected sepsis was 166{$\cdot$}0  (95\% CI 97{$\cdot$}69-234{$\cdot$}24) per 1000 livebirths, laboratory-confirmed sepsis was 46{$\cdot$}9  (19{$\cdot$}04-74{$\cdot$}79) per 1000 livebirths, and all-cause mortality was 0{$\cdot$}83 (0{$\cdot$}37-2{$\cdot$}00)  per 1000 neonate-days. Maternal hypertension, previous maternal hospitalisation  within 12 months, average or higher monthly household income, ward size ({$>$}11  beds), ward type (neonatal), living in a rural environment, preterm birth,  perinatal asphyxia, and multiple births were associated with an increased risk of  clinically suspected sepsis, laboratory-confirmed sepsis, and all-cause  mortality. The majority (881 [72{$\cdot$}5\%] of 1215) of laboratory-confirmed sepsis  cases occurred within the first 3 days of life. INTERPRETATION: Findings from  this study highlight the substantial proportion of neonates who develop neonatal  sepsis, and the high mortality rates among neonates with sepsis in LMICs. More  efficient and effective identification of neonatal sepsis is needed to target  interventions to reduce its incidence and subsequent mortality in LMICs.

The purpose of this study was to explore medication literacy in a group of Somali older adults and their families using qualitative secondary analysis. We conducted an analytic expansion of an existing qualitative study that explored the home healthcare perceptions of Somali older adults and their families. Qualitative data collected from 14 Somali families about home healthcare were reviewed and analyzed for material related to medication literacy. Data analysis revealed a number of important findings related to medication literacy and resulted in the discovery of four themes: Medication literacy is needed among Somali older adults and their families, Using home healthcare (HHC) to improve medication literacy, Better communication is essential to improving medication literacy, and Medication literacy is an intersecting family and social issue. The results of this study indicate that HHC has a role to play in improving the health and medication literacy of these families. They also highlight the need to further explore what techniques, tools, and/or supports HHC professionals need to care for non-English speaking populations. Future research needs to address how to meet the needs of diverse and vulnerable patients like Somali older adults, and how best to prepare HHC providers to do this.},

Postdischarge phone calls identified medication errors and medication reconciliation efforts by home healthcare clinicians.

We determined the types and frequency of medication errors among older Veterans receiving home healthcare, patient-provider communication patterns in this setting, and patient characteristics affecting medication error rates. Most Veterans (24/30, 80\%) had at least one discordant medication, and only one noted that errors were identified and resolved. Veterans were asked about medications in the home healthcare setting, but far fewer were questioned about medication-taking details, adherence, and as-needed or nonoral medications. Higher numeracy was associated with fewer errors. Veterans Administration community health nurses reported contact by home healthcare clinicians in 41\% of cases (7/17). Given the high rate of medication errors discovered, future work should focus on implementing best practices for medication review in this setting, as well as documenting barriers/facilitators of patient-provider communication.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the occurrence and pattern of adverse drug reactions as a cause for acute hospital admission. METHODS: In 681 randomly selected patients, acutely admitted to a clinic of internal medicine at a Swedish university hospital, information was collected from their medical records about current symptoms and use of drugs, previous diseases and the results of medical investigations and tests. In addition, a standardized interview according to a questionnaire was carried out. A group of experts in clinical pharmacology assessed the data obtained from the patients' case records and the results of the interviews, and then, according to WHO criteria, judged the probability that an adverse drug reaction could have caused or contributed to the actual admission to hospital. RESULTS: Out of the 681 cases included, 94 (13.8\%) had symptoms and signs that were judged as drug-related and that had caused or contributed to the admission. Eighty-two patients (12.0\%) had altogether 99 symptoms that were classified as adverse drug reactions. Of these, 91\% were type A reactions. The relationship between the medication and the reaction was judged certain in eight, probable in 17, and possible in 74 cases. The most common adverse drug reactions were cardiovascular (36.3\%). Twelve patients (1.8\%) had symptoms indicating intoxications. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of drug-related problems causing or contributing to admission to a clinic of internal medicine is high and is dominated by type A reactions, i.e. reactions in principle predictable and preventable. This implies a possibility to increase drug safety by preventive measures.},

Correlations among these variables in most urban areas have limited what conclusions can be drawn from existing research. Our study employs a unique factorial design of race, sex, age and individual poverty status, measuring time to death as an objective measure of health, and including both neighborhood economic status and income inequality for a sample of middle-aged urban-dwelling adults (N = 3675). At enrollment, African American and White participants lived in 46 unique census tracts in Baltimore, Maryland, which varied in neighborhood economic status and degree of income inequality. A Cox regression model for 9-year mortality identified a three-way interaction among sex, race and individual poverty status (p = 0.03), with African American men living below poverty having the highest mortality. Neighborhood economic status, whether measured by a composite index or simply median household income, was negatively associated with overall mortality (p{$<$}0.001). Neighborhood income inequality was associated with mortality through an interaction with individual poverty status (p = 0.04). While racial and economic disparities in mortality are well known, this study suggests that several social conditions associated with health may unequally affect African American men in poverty in the United States. Beyond these individual factors are the influences of neighborhood economic status and income inequality, which may be affected by a history of residential segregation. The significant association of neighborhood economic status and income inequality with mortality beyond the synergistic combination of sex, race and individual poverty status suggests the long-term importance of small area influence on overall mortality.},

In another cohort of 500 sibling-pairs, the sibling with lower self-control had poorer outcomes, despite shared family background.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sepsis is one of the main causes of death in newborns worldwide. Vitamin D levels during fetal and neonatal periods have a significant role in the  development of the immunological system. The study aims to evaluate the  association between vitamin D levels and the risk of early-onset neonatal sepsis  in full-term neonates in a developing country. METHODS: This case-control study  was conducted at the Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) of Kasr Alainy  Hospital, Cairo, Egypt. The study was composed of two groups; the sepsis group  involved full-term neonates appropriate for gestational age with sepsis-related  clinical signs. The control group included newborns with no signs of  clinical/laboratory infection within 72~h of life. Blood samples were collected  on admission during the first three days of life in both groups for the  measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, Complete Blood Count (CBC), C reactive  protein (CRP), and blood culture. RESULTS: Forty-five newborns with clinical and  laboratory findings of early-onset neonatal sepsis within 72~h of life were  enrolled, and the control group included forty-five newborns with no evidence of  sepsis. Vitamin D levels in the sepsis group were significantly lower than in the  control group. Apgar score at the first minute was significantly lower in the  sepsis group. 57.8\% of neonates with sepsis had positive blood cultures. There  was a statistical difference between deficient, insufficient, and sufficient  vitamin D levels regarding the duration of the NICU stay, which was longer in  neonates with deficient vitamin D levels. CRP was significantly higher in  neonates with deficient vitamin D levels. The area under the receiver operating  characteristic curve for serum vitamin D in the prediction of neonatal sepsis was  0.76 at a cutoff\,{$<$}\,19.7(ng/ml). CONCLUSION: In the current study, full-term  newborns with EOS had considerably lower vitamin D levels than healthy controls.  Through appropriate vitamin supplementation of the mothers during pregnancy, it  could be possible to ensure adequate vitamin D levels for newborns.~This may  contribute to the reduction of the risk of EOS, together with the other  well-known preventive measures (i.e. breastfeeding and intrapartum antibiotic  prophylaxis).},

  abstract = {In order to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics and to counteract the increase in antimicrobial resistance in community-acquired and nosocomial infections, a national project was initiated in Sweden in 1994: the Swedish Strategic Programme for the Rational Use of Antimicrobial Agents and Surveillance of Resistance. In the first years the project focused on inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics to children with respiratory tract infections and on the surveillance of resistance in pneumococci. Statistics on antibiotic sales on a national and county level and for different age-groups were studied. Between 1993 and 1997 antibiotic prescribing was reduced by 22\%, from 16.3 to 13.0 defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants/d. The reduction was most pronounced for children, 0-6-y-old, from 15.7 to 9.7 DDD/1000 children/d. Macrolides and amoxicillin/co-amoxyclav decreased most. There were large variations in antibiotic sales in different counties, and a decrease was also noted in counties starting from a low level. In the county with the highest sales in 1993, antibiotic prescribing to children was reduced by 40\%. The national frequency of penicillin-non-susceptible pneumococci (MIC {$>$} or =0.1 mg/l) has not increased during the 1990s and the increasing incidence in southern Sweden seems to have been curtailed. During the period that the project has been running, a major change in the use of antibiotics, especially for pre-school children, has been achieved.},

  abstract = {Increasing use of antibiotics and rising levels of bacterial resistance to antibiotics are a challenge to global health and development. Successful initiatives for containing the problem need to be communicated and disseminated. In Sweden, a rapid spread of resistant pneumococci in the southern part of the country triggered the formation of the Swedish strategic programme against antibiotic resistance, also known as Strama, in 1995. The creation of the programme was an important starting point for long-term coordinated efforts to tackle antibiotic resistance in the country. This paper describes the main strategies of the programme: committed work at the local and national levels; monitoring of antibiotic use for informed decision-making; a national target for antibiotic prescriptions; surveillance of antibiotic resistance for local, national and global action; tracking resistance trends; infection control to limit spread of resistance; and communication to raise awareness for action and behavioural change. A key element for achieving long-term changes has been the bottom-up approach, including working closely with prescribers at the local level. The work described here and the lessons learnt could inform countries implementing their own national action plans against antibiotic resistance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends benzylpenicillin and gentamicin as antimicrobial treatment for infants with sepsis in low-income  settings, and ceftriaxone or cefotaxime as an alternative. In a meta-analysis  from 13 low-income settings, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp. and  Escherichia coli accounted for 55\% of infants with sepsis. In a review of  bacterial meningitis, resistance to third generation cephalosporins was {$>$}50\% of  all isolates, and 44\% of Gram-negative isolates were gentamicin resistant.  However, ceftriaxone may cause neonatal jaundice, and gentamicin may cause  deafness. Therefore, we compared parenteral benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin with  ceftriaxone as first-line treatment, assessing outcome and adverse events.  METHODS: This was an open randomized trial carried out in the Queen Elizabeth  Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi, from 2010 to 2013. Infants {$<$}60 days of age  with possible severe sepsis received either benzylpenicillin and gentamicin or  ceftriaxone. Adverse events and outcomes were recorded until 6 months post  discharge. RESULTS: Three-hundred forty-eight infants were included in analyses.  Outcome in the benzylpenicillin and gentamicin and ceftriaxone groups was  similar; deaths were 13.7\% and 16.5\% and sequelae were 14.5\% and 11.2\%,  respectively. More infants in the penicillin/gentamicin group required  phototherapy: 15\% versus 5\%, P = 0.03. Thirteen (6\%) survivors had bilateral  hearing loss. There was no difference between the treatment groups. By 6 months  post discharge, 11 more infants had died, and 17 more children were found to have  sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftriaxone and gentamicin are safe for infants in our  setting. Infants should receive long-term follow-up as many poor outcomes  occurred after hospital discharge.},

METHODS: Resources identified through a Google search and environmental scan were evaluated using the Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM), an online readability text analysis tool, the DISCERN (quality), and caregivers' unmet needs checklist (usefulness). Descriptive analyses and cluster analysis to identify the group of resources with the highest SAM and DISCERN scores were performed. RESULTS: 55 resources were evaluated. The suitability of 48/55 (87\%) resources were categorized as adequate (SAM scores 40-69), with no resources ranking in the superior category (SAM scores {$>$} 70\%). The readability of 51/55 (93\%) resources exceeded 9th grade reading level. The mean quality score as a percentage was 49\% (SD 11.5). On average resources addressed 9.9/33 unmet needs (SD\,=\,5.8). A high-quality cluster was identified and included 15 (27\%) websites. CONCLUSION: Online resources for cancer caregivers are not optimal in terms of their suitability, readability, quality, and usefulness. The highest ranked resources include, Cancer Council Australia's booklet, Caring for Someone with Cancer, and the American Cancer Society's webpages, Caregivers and Families. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Study findings will allow healthcare professionals to better address cancer caregivers' needs by recommending the most optimal resources.},

METHOD: Qualitative study using inductive and deductive qualitative content analysis was conducted in a large, urban, level I trauma centre. Interviews were conducted with 23 caregivers of persons with TBI. Participants' perspectives on communication and preparation for discharge were explored and understanding of commonly used words and discharge instructions were assessed. RESULTS: Four types of communication patterns were identified: formal, informal, indirect and caregiver-initiated. Informal and caregiver-initiated communication were the most common. All caregivers reported confusion about their family member's condition, care plan or discharge plan. Caregivers were not able to define commonly used terms in discharge instructions, and were confused by formatting and medical language. Caregivers were not aware of expected caregiving roles upon discharge. Conceptualizing findings within a family-centred care model, we offer specific strategies to improve health communication and caregiver capacity building to enhance health literacy. CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy and caregiver capacity to care for loved ones with TBI after hospital discharge is low. We offer specific target areas for improvement in verbal and written communication and capacity building that take into account provider, patient and family characteristics.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Cancer caregivers play a vital role in the care and health decision-making of cancer survivors. Consequently, their health literacy levels may be particularly important, as low levels may impede adequate care provision. As such, the current review aimed to systematically examine the literature on health literacy amongst cancer caregivers. METHODS: We systematically searched the following databases using controlled vocabulary and free-text terms: PsychINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science. Peer-reviewed empirical studies that explicitly measured and reported cancer caregiver health literacy levels were included. RESULTS: The search yielded six articles consisting of 593 cancer caregivers exploring health literacy and eHealth literacy. There was substantial variation in health literacy measurement tools used across included studies, precluding the possibility of conducting a meta-analysis. The included articles reported significant associations (limited to single studies) between caregiver health/eHealth literacy and (i) cancer survivor demographics, (ii) caregivers' communication style, (iii) caregiver Internet access and (iv) caregiver coping strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight a need for future longitudinal research regarding cancer caregiver health literacy incorporating more standardized and population-specific measurement approaches. In particular, there is a pressing need to investigate factors associated with cancer caregiver health literacy to inform the development/delivery of future interventions. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Future high-quality research which investigates the factors which contribute towards sub-optimal health literacy amongst cancer caregivers would aid in the development of appropriate and effective health literacy interventions in these groups. Such interventions would allow this important group to provide appropriate support to cancer survivors and enhance survivors' engagement in their health and wellbeing.},

  abstract = {Background: Three-quarters of all annual neonatal deaths in developing countries are attributable to neonatal sepsis. In primary care settings, poor cord hygiene  due to improper handling of the infant's cord is a major contributor to the  occurrence of neonatal sepsis. The objective of this study was to describe the  umbilical cord practices among mothers attending a primary care facility, assess  the relationship between umbilical cord hygiene and neonatal sepsis, its impact  on the population, as well as the influence of other neonatal and maternal  factors on this relationship. Methods: A case-control study was conducted to  assess the umbilical cord hygiene-neonatal sepsis relationship among neonates  attending a primary care facility between August and October 2018. All cases were  selected, while controls were systematically random sampled, as per study  eligibility criteria. Exposure variables were summarized using descriptive  statistics. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to evaluate the  association between umbilical cord hygiene and neonatal sepsis adjusting for the  effect of potential confounders. Subsequently, a population attributable fraction  (PAF) was estimated. Results: The proportion of mothers with improper hygiene was  35.3\%: 72.1\% among the cases and 16.3\% among the controls' caregivers. The odds  of neonatal sepsis were 13 times higher (OR=13.24; 95\% CI: [7.5; 23.4]) among  infants whose caregivers had improper hygiene compared to those who had proper  hygiene. None of the neonatal and maternal covariates confounded the umbilical  cord hygiene-neonatal sepsis association. This odds ratio gave a PAF of 66.7\%  (95\% CI: 62.5; 69.0). Conclusions: Improper cord hygiene is prevalent in this low  resource setting. Improper cord hygiene has a strong positive association with  neonatal sepsis. Observing good cord care practices could avert up to 67\% of  newborn infections. This calls for inclusion of comprehensive cord care practices  in the antenatal care educational package.},

Nonetheless, we have limited information on unplanned rehospitalizations and the related risk factors in elderly patients admitted to in-hospital rehabilitation facilities after an acute hospitalization. SETTING: In-hospital rehabilitation and aged care unit. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Elderly patients 65 years or older admitted to an in-hospital rehabilitation hospital after an acute hospitalization between January 2004 and June~2011. MEASUREMENTS: The rate of 30-day unplanned rehospitalization to hospitals was recorded. Risk factors for unplanned rehospitalization were evaluated at rehabilitation admission: age, comorbidity, serum albumin, number of drugs, decline in functional status, delirium, Mini Mental State Examination score, and length of stay in the acute hospital. A multivariable Cox proportional regression model was used to identify the effect of these risk factors for time to event within the 30-day follow-up. RESULTS: Among 2735 patients, with a median age of 80 years (interquartile range 74-85), 98 (4\%) were rehospitalized within 30 days. Independent predictors of 30-day unplanned rehospitalization were the use of 7 or more drugs (hazard ratio [HR], 3.94; 95\% confidence interval, 1.62-9.54; P~= .002) and a significant decline in functional status (56 points or more at the Barthel Index) compared with the month before hospital admission (HR 2.67, 95\% CI: 1.35-5.27; P~= .005). Additionally, a length of stay in the acute hospital of 13 days or more carried a twofold higher risk of rehospitalization (HR 2.67, 95\% CI: 1.39-5.10); P~= .003). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of unplanned rehospitalization was low in this study. Polypharmacy, a significant worsening of functional status compared with the month before acute hospital admission, and hospital length of stay are important risk factors.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) in a cohort of community-dwelling middle-aged people and assess the relationship between PIP and emergency department (ED) visits, general practitioner (GP) visits and quality of life (QoL). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), a nationally representative cohort study of ageing. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 45-64 years recruited to TILDA who were eligible for the means-tested General Medical Services scheme and followed up after 2 years. EXPOSURE: PIP was determined in the 12 months preceding baseline and follow-up TILDA data collection by applying the PRescribing Optimally in Middle-aged People's Treatments (PROMPT) criteria to participants' medication dispensing data. OUTCOME MEASURES: At follow-up, the reported rates of ED and GP visits over 12 months (primary outcome) and the CASP-R12 (Control Autonomy Self-realisation Pleasure) measure of QoL (secondary outcome). ANALYSIS: Multivariate negative binomial (rates) and linear regression (CASP-R12) models controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: At 2-year follow-up (n=808), PIP was detected in 42.9\% by the PROMPT criteria. An ED visit was reported by 18.7\% and 94.4\% visited a GP (median 4 visits, IQR 2-6). Exposure to {$>$}/=2 PROMPT criteria was associated with higher rates of healthcare utilisation and lower QoL in unadjusted regression. However, in multivariate analysis, the associations between PIP and rates of ED visits (adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.92, 95\% CI 0.53 to 1.58), and GP visits (IRR 1.06, 95\% CI 0.87 to 1.28), and CASP-R12 score (adjusted beta coefficient 0.35, 95\% CI -0.93 to 1.64) were not statistically significant. Numbers of medicines and comorbidities were associated with higher healthcare utilisation. CONCLUSIONS: Although PIP was prevalent in this study population, there was no evidence of a relationship with ED and GP visits and QoL. Further research should evaluate whether the PROMPT criteria are related to these and other adverse outcomes in the general middle-aged population.},

  abstract = {Objective: Polypharmacy is the concomitant use of several drugs by a single person, and it increases the risk of adverse drug-related events in older adults. Little is known about the epidemiology of polypharmacy at the population level. We aimed to measure the prevalence and incidence of polypharmacy and to investigate the associated factors. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted using register data with national coverage in Sweden. A total of 1,742,336 individuals aged {$\geq$}65 years at baseline (November 1, 2010) were included and followed until death or the end of the study (December 20, 2013). Results: On average, individuals were exposed to 4.6 (SD =4.0) drugs at baseline. The prevalence of polypharmacy (5+ drugs) was 44.0\%, and the prevalence of excessive polypharmacy (10+ drugs) was 11.7\%. The incidence rate of polypharmacy among individuals without polypharmacy at baseline was 19.9 per 100 person-years, ranging from 16.8\% in individuals aged 65--74 years to 33.2\% in those aged {$\geq$}95 years (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] =1.49, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.42--1.56). The incidence rate of excessive polypharmacy was 8.0 per 100 person-years. Older adults using multi-dose dispensing were at significantly higher risk of developing incident polypharmacy compared with those receiving ordinary prescriptions (HR =1.51, 95\% CI 1.47--1.55). When adjusting for confounders, living in nursing home was found to be associated with lower risks of incident polypharmacy and incident excessive polypharmacy (HR =0.79 and HR =0.86, p{$<$}0.001, respectively). Conclusion: The prevalence and incidence of polypharmacy are high among older adults in Sweden. Interventions aimed at reducing the prevalence of polypharmacy should also target potential incident polypharmacy users as they are the ones who fuel future polypharmacy.},

It may improve the quality of life in cancer patients and for those persons receiving palliative care. Caloric supplementation should include a balanced essential amino acid supplement given at least twice a day. The role of eicosapentanoic acid as a supplement is controversial. All caloric supplements should be given between and not with meals. SUMMARY: Caloric supplementation rich in protein and with adequate vitamin D should be given between meals to all patients with cachexia.},

MEASUREMENTS: The 5-item FRAIL scale (fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight), at baseline and activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), mortality, short physical performance battery (SPPB), gait speed, one-leg stand, grip strength and injurious falls at baseline and 9 years. Blood tests for CRP, SIL6R, STNFR1, STNFR2 and 25 (OH) vitamin D at baseline. RESULTS: Cross-sectionally the FRAIL scale correlated significantly with IADL difficulties, SPPB, grip strength and one-leg stand among participants with no baseline ADL difficulties (N=703) and those outcomes plus gait speed in those with no baseline ADL dependencies (N=883). TNFR1 was increased in pre-frail and frail subjects and CRP in some subgroups. Longitudinally (N=423 with no baseline ADL difficulties or N=528 with no baseline ADL dependencies), and adjusted for the baseline value for each outcome, being pre-frail at baseline significantly predicted future ADL difficulties, worse one-leg stand scores, and mortality in both groups, plus IADL difficulties in the dependence-excluded group. Being frail at baseline significantly predicted future ADL difficulties, IADL difficulties, and mortality in both groups, plus worse SPPB in the dependence-excluded group. CONCLUSION: This study has validated the FRAIL scale in a late middle-aged African American population. This simple 5-question scale is an excellent screening test for clinicians to identify frail persons at risk of developing disability as well as decline in health functioning and mortality.},

Frailty can occur as the result of a range of diseases and medical conditions. A consensus group consisting of delegates from 6 major international, European, and US societies created 4 major consensus points on a specific form of frailty: physical frailty. 1. Physical frailty is an important medical syndrome. The group defined physical frailty as "a medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors that is characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function that increases an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death." 2. Physical frailty can potentially be prevented or treated with specific modalities, such as exercise, protein-calorie supplementation, vitamin D, and reduction of polypharmacy. 3. Simple, rapid screening tests have been developed and validated, such as the simple FRAIL scale, to allow physicians to objectively recognize frail persons. 4. For the purposes of optimally managing individuals with physical frailty, all persons older than 70 years and all individuals with significant weight loss ({$>$}5\%) due to chronic disease should be screened for frailty.},

However, the prevalence and etiology of limited health literacy among hospitalized adults and the compensatory strategies used are not known. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and demographic associations of limited health literacy in hospitalized patients and to identify the perceived etiology and use of any compensatory strategies. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was implemented of a consecutive sample of hospitalized adults admitted to the Internal Medicine Hospitalist Service at a 440-bed academic medical center (n = 103) in Vermont. Health literacy was determined using the short form of the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. Demographic data, perceived etiology of difficulties in reading or understanding health information, and use of compensatory strategies were self-reported. RESULTS: Sixty percent of medical inpatients have limited health literacy. Thirty-six percent of patients with limited health literacy attribute this to difficulties with vision. Sixty-two percent of all medical inpatients rely on help from a health professional, and 23\% look to a family member when faced with challenges in reading or understanding health information. DISCUSSION: The prevalence of limited health literacy is high in hospitalized medical patients. Further study of the timing and methods of communicating information to hospitalized patients is warranted. Assuring that the patient and/or family understand the postdischarge plans will be an important step to improving quality and safety.},

Understanding the dynamic nature of health literacy is important when tailoring health messages, especially those targeted at the management of chronic health conditions. METHOD: This was a descriptive longitudinal study of 751 adults with diabetes randomly selected from primary care practices in the Vermont Diabetes Information System study between July 2003 and December 2007. Participants were interviewed and completed questionnaires upon entrance into the study and again 24 months later. Health literacy was measured with the Short Test for Functional Health Literacy of Adults. Participants also completed the SF-12 and the Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire and self-reported their sex, income, education, marital status, race/ethnicity, health insurance, duration of diabetes, and problems with vision. RESULTS: A significant decrease in health literacy was noted over 24 months. The largest decrease was in adults {$\geq$}65 years of age and those with higher physical function at baseline. Smaller declines were noted for women and participants who were white, higher educated, poly-pharmacy users, and with fair to excellent vision. CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy exhibits decline with increasing age among adults with diabetes. Individual variability in health literacy has implications for the best timing and approach to provide self-management education and support.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus is a cause of postinfectious hydrocephalus among Ugandan infants. To determine whether Paenibacillus spp is a  pathogen in neonatal sepsis, meningitis, and postinfectious hydrocephalus, we  aimed to complete three separate studies of Ugandan infants. The first study was  on peripartum prevalence of Paenibacillus in mother-newborn pairs. The second  study assessed Paenibacillus in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from neonates  with sepsis. The third study assessed Paenibacillus in CSF from infants with  hydrocephalus. METHODS: In this observational study, we recruited mother-newborn  pairs with and without maternal fever (mother-newborn cohort), neonates (aged {$\leq$}28  days) with sepsis (sepsis cohort), and infants (aged {$\leq$}90 days) with hydrocephalus  with and without a history of neonatal sepsis and meningitis (hydrocephalus  cohort) from three hospitals in Uganda between Jan 13, 2016 and Oct 2, 2019. We  collected maternal blood, vaginal swabs, and placental samples and the cord from  the mother-newborn pairs, and blood and CSF from neonates and infants. Bacterial  content of infant CSF was characterised by 16S rDNA sequencing. We analysed all  samples using quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting either the Paenibacillus genus or  Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus spp. We collected cranial ultrasound and computed  tomography images in the subset of participants represented in more than one  cohort. FINDINGS: No Paenibacillus spp were detected in vaginal, maternal blood,  placental, or cord blood specimens from the mother-newborn cohort by qPCR.  Paenibacillus spp was detected in 6\% (37 of 631 neonates) in the sepsis cohort  and, of these, 14\% (5 of 37 neonates) developed postinfectious hydrocephalus.  Paenibacillus was the most enriched bacterial genera in postinfectious  hydrocephalus CSF (91 [44\%] of 209 patients) from the hydrocephalus cohort, with  16S showing 94\% accuracy when validated by qPCR. Imaging showed progression from  Paenibacillus spp-related meningitis to postinfectious hydrocephalus over 1-3  months. Patients with postinfectious hydrocephalus with Paenibacillus spp  infections were geographically clustered. INTERPRETATION: Paenibacillus spp  causes neonatal sepsis and meningitis in Uganda and is the dominant cause of  subsequent postinfectious hydrocephalus. There was no evidence of transplacental  transmission, and geographical evidence was consistent with an environmental  source of neonatal infection. Further work is needed to identify routes of  infection and optimise treatment of neonatal Paenibacillus spp infection to  lessen the burden of morbidity and mortality.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Rural adults (n = 575), hospitalized for heart failure within the past 6 months, completed the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (STOFHLA) to measure health literacy and were followed for {$>$}/=2 years. The percentage of patients with the end point of heart failure readmission or all-cause death was different (P = .001) among the 3 STOFHLA score levels. Unadjusted analysis revealed that patients with inadequate and marginal health literacy were 1.94 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.43-2.63; P {$<$} .001) times, and 1.91 (95\% CI 1.36-2.67; P {$<$} .001) times, respectively, more likely to experience the outcome. After adjustment for covariates, health literacy remained a predictor of outcomes. Of the other covariates, worse functional class, higher comorbidity burden, and higher depression score predicted worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Inadequate or marginal health literacy is a risk factor for heart failure rehospitalization or all-cause mortality among rural patients with heart failure.},

This observational cohort study examined the association of health literacy with medication knowledge, adherence, and adverse drug events among cognitively intact veterans older than 65 years old who were taking 5 or more medications and who were enrolled in a Veterans Administration primary care clinic. Health literacy was determined by the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine. Medication knowledge and adherence were assessed by clinical pharmacist interview and refill data. Adverse drug events were determined by interview and chart review at 3 and 12 months. The 310 subjects had a mean age of 74 years, 99\% were White, and 97\% were male. Percentage of medications known was 29\% for the low health literacy group versus 49\% (marginal) and 56\% (adequate), p {$<$} .001. Known medication purposes were lower in the lower health literacy group (49\% vs. 71\% vs. 74\%; p {$<$} .001). Health literacy was not associated with medication adherence: the low health literacy group took 84\% of medications by label instructions compared with 80\% (marginal) and 77\% (adequate), p = .14; or with adverse drug events at 1 year (48\% vs. 33\% vs. 40\%; p = .30). Patients with lower health literacy have poorer medication knowledge but not lower adherence or increased adverse drug events.},

Moreover, 68.3\% of respondents reported consuming antibiotics 1-3 times per year, while 22.4\% consumed antibiotics on their own accord. Approximately 66.7\% realized that abusing antibiotics could lead to resistance. Participant knowledge and attitudes were significantly associated with monthly family income, educational level, place of residency, having medical insurance, working in the health sector or having a relative working in the health sector.

Although not all such hospitalizations can be avoided, admission rates in populations and communities can vary depending on access to primary care, care-seeking behaviors, and the quality of care available. Because hospitalization tends to be costlier than outpatient or primary care, potentially preventable hospitalizations often are tracked as markers of health system efficiency. The number and cost of potentially preventable hospitalizations also can be calculated to help identify potential cost savings associated with reducing these hospitalizations overall and for specific populations.},

In the DRC, neonatal  sepsis causes 15.6\% of this mortality, but data on the bacterial etiology and  associated drug susceptibility are lacking. METHODS: Hemocultures of 150 neonates  with possible early-onset neonatal sepsis (pEOS) were obtained at the H{\^o}pital  Provincial G{\'e}n{\'e}ral de R{\'e}f{\'e}rence de Bukavu (Bukavu, DRC). The newborns with pEOS  received an empirical first-line antimicrobial treatment (ampicillin, cefotaxime,  and gentamicin) based on the synopsis of international guidelines for the  management of EOS that are in line with World Health Organization (WHO)  recommendations. Isolates were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/  ionization time-of-flight mass spectrophotometry. Antibiotic resistance was  assessed using the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Fifty strains were obtained  from 48 patients and identified. The 3 most prevalent species were Enterobacter  cloacae complex (42\%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (18\%), and Serratia marcescens  (12\%). Enterobacter cloacae isolates were resistant to all first-line  antibiotics. All K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens isolates were resistant to  ampicillin, and the majority of the K. pneumoniae and half of the S. marcescens  isolates were resistant to both cefotaxime and gentamicin. All E. cloacae complex  strains, 89\% of K. pneumoniae, and half of S. marcescens had an extended-spectrum  {\ss}-lactamase phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The most prevalent pathogens causing EOS in  Bukavu were E. cloacae complex, K. pneumoniae, and S. marcescens. Most of these  isolates were resistant to the WHO-recommended antibiotics.},

Despite the development of new  infection markers, C-reactive protein (CRP) is the most extensively studied acute  phase reactant so far and the preferred index in many neonatal intensive care  units (NICUs). The aim of the present study was to evaluate an affordable,  non-commercial turbidimetric CRP assay for monitoring early-onset neonatal sepsis  (EOS). METHODS: A total of 148 neonates admitted at the NICU of the H{\^o}pital  Provincial G{\'e}n{\'e}ral de R{\'e}f{\'e}rence de Bukavu to diagnose and to monitor EOS were  enrolled in the study. CRP was assayed using a functional turbidimetric assay  based on the interaction of CRP with phosphocholine containing particles  (Intralipid({\textregistered})). RESULTS: In total, 62/148 (41.9\%) cases were identified as blood  culture-proven EOS. Different serum CRP slopes were observed among the different  birth weight categories. Moreover, the serum (CRP 48 h-CRP 12 h) difference and  the birth weight predicted the outcome of these septic newborns. CONCLUSIONS: Our  turbidimetric CRP assay is a potential novel tool that can be used in the  management of EOS in sub-Saharan Africa. The simplicity of the assay and the  extremely low price make the CRP method very well suited for developing  countries.},

These 2 methods have not been directly compared in terms of how they identify high-performing and low-performing hospitals. OBJECTIVES: To examine how consistently the CMS and PPR methods identify performance outliers, and explore how the PPR preventability component impacts hospital readmission rates, public reporting on CMS' Hospital Compare website, and pay-for-performance under CMS' Hospital Readmission Reduction Program for 3 conditions (acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia). METHODS: We applied the CMS all-cause model and the PPR software to VA administrative data to calculate 30-day observed FY08-10 VA hospital readmission rates and hospital profiles. We then tested the effect of preventability on hospital readmission rates and outlier identification for reporting and pay-for-performance by replacing the dependent variable in the CMS all-cause model (Yes/No readmission) with the dichotomous PPR outcome (Yes/No preventable readmission). RESULTS: The CMS and PPR methods had moderate correlations in readmission rates for each condition. After controlling for all methodological differences but preventability, correlations increased to {$>$}90\%. The assessment of preventability yielded different outlier results for public reporting in 7\% of hospitals; for 30\% of hospitals there would be an impact on Hospital Readmission Reduction Program reimbursement rates. CONCLUSIONS: Despite uncertainty over which readmission measure is superior in evaluating hospital performance, we confirmed that there are differences in CMS-generated and PPR-generated hospital profiles for reporting and pay-for-performance, because of methodological differences and the PPR's preventability component.},

DESIGN: Descriptive secondary analysis. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The sample included 48 family/friend adult caregivers of individuals who had AD. Seventy-five percent were female; their mean age was 64 {\textpm} 14 years (mean {\textpm} SD). Caregivers were spouses (44\%), daughters (31\%), or extended family members/friends (25\%). Nearly half (48\%) of caregivers had a racially or ethnically diverse background; 58\% of their care recipients had incontinence. METHODS: Data were collected via focus groups, interviews, and written surveys. Verbal responses were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed for themes by caregiver type using content analysis. RESULTS: Caregivers of persons with AD described role-related barriers to improving health literacy about incontinence and its management. Main themes of barriers emerged for each type of role that were emotive in nature for daughters, experiential for both spouse caregivers, system related for husbands, and relational (being perceived as an outsider) for extended family/friends. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse continence specialists have an important role in raising health literacy about incontinence and its management for informal caregivers of individual with AD. Results inform the development of interventions that are tailored to the type of caregiver as recommended by national health literacy initiatives with the aim of improving outcomes such as incontinence of care recipients.},

  abstract = {Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) has shown positive effects in endurance-type sports among healthy young individuals; however, its effects in endurance-type exercises in older adults have not been explored. We aimed to examine the acute effects of a single session of IPC prior to an endurance-type exercise on cardiovascular- and physical-function-related parameters in sedentary older adults. A pilot study with a time-series design was carried out. Nine participants were enrolled consecutively in the following intervention groups: (i) SHAM (sham IPC + walking) and (ii) IPC (IPC + walking) groups. The main outcomes were resting systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, heart rate (HR), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), maximum isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC), endurance performance, and perceived fatigue. After the intervention, the IPC group showed a significant reduction in SBP, whereas SpO2 decreased in the SHAM group. The IPC group maintained quadriceps MIVC levels, whereas these levels dropped in the SHAM group. No changes in DBP, resting HR, endurance, or fatigue in any group were observed. These findings are of interest for the promotion of cardiovascular and physical health in older people.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Early hospital readmissions remain common in patients with conditions targeted by the CMS Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP). There is still no consensus on whether readmission measures should be adjusted based on social factors, and there are few population studies within the U.S. examining how social characteristics influence readmissions for HRRP-targeted conditions. The objective of this study was to determine if specific socio-demographic and -economic factors are associated with 30-day readmissions in HRRP-targeted conditions: acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure.                                         Methods               The Nationwide Readmissions Database was used to identify patients admitted with HRRP-targeted conditions between January 1, 2010 and September 30, 2015. Stroke was included as a control condition because it is not included in the HRRP. Multivariate models were used to assess the relationship between three social and economic characteristics (gender, urban/rural hospital designation, and estimated median household income within the patient's zip code) and 30-day readmission rates using a hierarchical two-level logistic model. Age-adjusted models were used to assess relationship differences between Medicare vs. non-Medicare populations.                                         Results                                There were 19,253,997 weighted index hospital admissions for all diagnoses and 3,613,488 30-day readmissions between 2010 and 2015. Patients in the lowest income quartile ({$\leq\$$}37,999) had an increased odds of 30-day readmission across all conditions (                 P                 ~{$<$}\,0.0001). Female gender and rural hospital designation were associated with a decreased odds of 30-day readmission for most targeted conditions (                 P                 ~{$<$}\,0.05). Similar findings were also seen in patients {$\geq$}65\,years old.                                                        Conclusions               Socio-demographic and -economic factors are associated with 30-day readmission rates and should be incorporated into tools or interventions to improve discharge planning and mitigate against readmission.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal systemic infections and their consequent impairments give rise to long-lasting health, economic and social effects on the neonate, the  family and the nation. Considering the dearth of consolidated economic evidence  in this important area, this systematic review aims to critically appraise and  consolidate the evidence on economic evaluations of management of neonatal  systemic infections in South Asia. METHODS: Full and partial economic  evaluations, published in English, associated with the management of neonatal  systemic infections in South Asia will be included. Any intervention related to  management of neonatal systemic infections will be eligible for inclusion.  Comparison can include a placebo or alternative standard of care. Interventions  without any comparators will also be eligible for inclusion. Outcomes of this  review will include measures related to resource use, costs and  cost-effectiveness. Electronic searches will be conducted on PubMed, CINAHL,  MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, Web of Science, EconLit, the Centre for Reviews and  Dissemination Library (CRD) Database, Popline, IndMed, MedKnow, IMSEAR, the Cost  Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) Registry and Pediatric Economic Database Evaluation  (PEDE). Conference proceedings and grey literature will be searched in addition  to performing back referencing of bibliographies of included studies. Two authors  will independently screen studies (in title, abstract and full-text stages),  extract data and assess risk of bias. A narrative summary and tables will be used  to summarize the characteristics and results of included studies. DISCUSSION:  Neonatal systemic infections can have significant economic repercussions on the  families, health care providers and, cumulatively, the nation. Pediatric economic  evaluations have focused on the under-five age group, and published consolidated  economic evidence for neonates is missing in the developing world context. To the  best of our knowledge, this is the first review of economic evidence on neonatal  systemic infections in the South Asian context. Further, this protocol provides  an underst anding of the methods used to design and evaluate economic evidence  for methodological quality, transparency and focus on health equity. This review  will also highlight existing gaps in research and identify scope for further  research. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42017047275.},

We performed a secondary analysis of data from a national sample of Australians aged 40 to 50~years (n~=~1318) recruited online. Health literacy was measured using the validated Newest Vital Sign (inadequate: 0--3; adequate: 4--6). Analysed outcomes included: willingness to increase exercise and accept medication; perceived severity; positive and negative affect; illness perceptions and impacts on life and motivation. Participants with inadequate levels of health literacy perceived a blood pressure reading of 135/85~mmHg to be less serious compared to individuals with adequate health literacy (Mean Difference [MD]:0.21; 95\%CI 0.03--0.39; p~=~.024; d~=~0.13), and reported less motivation to eat well (MD:0.44; 95\%CI 0.31--0.58; p~{$<~$}.001; d~=~0.38) and exercise (MD:0.43; 95\%CI 0.31--0.58; p~{$<~$}.001; d~=~0.36). However, they were more willing to accept medication (MD:0.20; 95\%CI 0.07--0.34; p~=~.004; d~=~0.17). Participants with inadequate health literacy also perceived the condition to have fewer negative impacts on aspects of life and work than individuals with adequate health literacy, but reported greater negative emotion and more negative illness perceptions (all p~{$<~$}.001). Tailored communication and behaviour change support may be needed when communicating blood pressure information to people with lower health literacy and not at high risk of cardiovascular disease given the differential impacts on medication (increased willingness) and healthy exercise and diet behaviours (decreased willingness) observed in this study.},

  abstract = {To better understand the degree to which risk-standardized thirty-day readmission rates may be influenced by social factors, we compared results for hospitals in Missouri under two types of models. The first type of model is currently used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for public reporting of condition-specific hospital readmission rates of Medicare patients. The second type of model is an ``enriched'' version of the first type of model with census tract-level socioeconomic data such as poverty rate, educational attainment, and housing vacancy rate. We found that the inclusion of these factors had a pronounced effect on calculated hospital readmission rates for patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia. Specifically, the models including socioeconomic data narrowed the range of observed variation in readmission rates for the above conditions, in percentage points, from 6.5 to 1.8, 14.0 to 7.4, and 7.4 to 3.7, respectively. Interestingly the average readmission rates for the three conditions did not change significantly between the two types of models. The results of our exploratory analysis suggest that further work to characterize and report the effects of socioeconomic factors on standardized readmission measures may assist efforts to improve care quality and deliver more equitable care on the part of hospitals, payers, and other stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Studies on the epidemiology and genomes of isolates harboring OXA-48-like genes in septicemic neonates are rare. Here, isolates producing these carbapenemases  which emerged and persisted in an Indian neonatal unit were characterized in  terms of their resistome, transmissibility, and genome diversity. Antibiotic  susceptibility and whole-genome sequencing were carried out. The sequence types,  resistome, virulome, mobile genetic elements, and transmissibility of  carbapenem-resistant plasmids were evaluated. Core genome analysis of isolates  was shown in a global context with other OXA-48-like carbapenemase-harboring  genomes, including those from neonatal studies. Eleven OXA-48-like  carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (bla(OXA-181), n\,=\,7 and  bla(OXA-232), n\,=\,4) isolates belonging to diverse sequence types (ST14, ST15,  ST23, ST48, and ST231) were identified. bla(OXA-181/OXA-232) and bla(NDM-5) were  found in a high-risk clone, ST14 (n\,=\,4). bla(OXA-181/OXA-232) were in small,  nonconjugative ColKP3 plasmids located on truncated Tn2013, whereas bla(NDM-5)  was in self-transmissible, conjugative IncFII plasmids, within truncated Tn125  Conjugal transfer of bla(OXA-181/OXA-232) was observed in the presence of  bla(NDM-5) The study strains were diverse among themselves and showed various  levels of relatedness with non-neonatal strains from different parts of the world  and similarity with neonatal strains from Tanzania and Ghana when compared with a  representative collection of carbapenemase-positive K. pneumoniae strains. We  found that bla(OXA-181/OXA-232)-harboring isolates from a single neonatal unit  had remarkably diverse genomes, ruling out clonal spread and emphasizing the  extent of plasmid spreading across different STs. This study is probably the  first to report the coexistence of bla(OXA-181/232) and bla(NDM-5) in neonatal  isolates.IMPORTANCE Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal mortality in  low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Treatment of sepsis in this vulnerable  population is dependent on antimicrobials, and resistance to these life-saving  antimicrobials is worrisome. Carbapenemases, enzymes produced by bacteria, can  make these antimicrobials useless. Our study describes how OXA-48-like  carbapenemases in neonatal septicemic Klebsiella pneumoniae shows remarkable  diversity in the genomes of the strains and relatedness with strains from other  parts of world and also to some neonatal outbreak strains. It is also the first  to describe such resistance due to coproduction of dual carbapenemases, (OXA)-48  and New Delhi metallo-{$\beta$}-lactamase-5, in Klebsiella pneumoniae from neonatal  settings. Carbapenemase genes situated on plasmids within high-risk international  clones, as seen here, increase the ease and transfer of resistant genetic  material. With the WHO treatment protocols not adequately poised to handle such  infections, prompt attention to neonatal health care is required.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objectives of the study were to investigate the level of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding antibiotics of the general population in Italy, and to assess the correlates of these outcomes of interest. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on a random sample of 630 parents of students attending nine randomly selected public primary and secondary schools. A self-administered questionnaire included questions on demographic characteristics, knowledge about antibiotic use and resistance, attitudes and behaviors towards antibiotic use, and sources of information. RESULTS: A total of 419 parents participated. Only 9.8\% knew the definition of antibiotic resistance and 21.2\% knew when it was appropriate to use antibiotics. Respondents with higher education, employed, with a family member working in the health care sector, and with no need for additional information on antibiotics were more likely to know the definition of antibiotic resistance. One third (32.7\%) self-classified them as users of self-medication with antibiotics and those with a lower self-rated health status, who did not use the physician as source of information on antibiotics, and who have attended a physician in the last year were more likely to use self-medication. One-fourth (22.7\%) of those who had never been self-medicated would be willing to take an antibiotic without a prescription of a physician. Respondents were more likely to be willing to take antibiotics without a prescription if they were under 40 years of age, if they had a lower self-rated health status, if they did not know that antibiotics are not indicated for treating flu and sore throat, and if they knew that antibiotics are not indicated for treating colds. CONCLUSIONS: The survey has generated information about knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding antibiotics in the general population and effective public education initiative should provide practical and appropriate means to change their behavior.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Intensive diabetes therapy aimed at achieving near normoglycemia reduces the risk of microvascular and neurologic complications of type 1 diabetes. We studied whether the use of intensive therapy as compared with conventional therapy during the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) affected the long-term incidence of cardiovascular disease. METHODS The DCCT randomly assigned 1441 patients with type 1 diabetes to intensive or conventional therapy, treating them for a mean of 6.5 years between 1983 and 1993. Ninety-three percent were subsequently followed until February 1, 2005, during the observational Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study. Cardiovascular disease (defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, death from cardiovascular disease, confirmed angina, or the need for coronary-artery revascularization) was assessed with standardized measures and classified by an independent committee. RESULTS During the mean 17 years of follow-up, 46 cardiovascular disease events occurred in 31 patients who had received intensive treatment in the DCCT, as compared with 98 events in 52 patients who had received conventional treatment. Intensive treatment reduced the risk of any cardiovascular disease event by 42 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 9 to 63 percent; P=0.02) and the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular disease by 57 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 79 percent; P=0.02). The decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin values during the DCCT was significantly associated with most of the positive effects of intensive treatment on the risk of cardiovascular disease. Microalbuminuria and albuminuria were associated with a significant increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease, but differences between treatment groups remained significant (P{$\leq$}0.05) after adjusting for these factors. CONCLUSIONS Intensive diabetes therapy has long-term beneficial effects on the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 1 diabetes.},

At the same time, the complexity of health care delivery continues to grow, creating challenges that are magnified for older adults, given that age is one of the highest correlates of low health literacy. This creates a shared obligation between health care and the health care team to use the principles, tools, and practices of health literacy so that patients and families of older adults can more easily navigate discussions related to chronic disease, polypharmacy, long-term care, palliative care, insurance complexities, the social determinants of health, and other factors that create challenges for older adults, particularly among underserved populations nationwide. To gain a better understanding of the health communication challenges among older adults and their professional and family caregivers and how those challenges affect the care older adults receive, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Roundtable on Health Literacy convened a 1-day public workshop featuring presentations and discussions that examined the effect of low health literacy on the health of older adults.

  abstract = {In June 2013 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence updated and replaced its 2004 clinical guideline 21 (CG21) on falls with clinical guideline 161 (CG161). Two priorities were outlined in the latter: preventing falls in older people (unchanged from CG21) and preventing falls in older people during a hospital stay (new). CG161 is for health and social care clinicians who care for older people who have fallen or who are at risk of falling. It provides clinicians and commissioners with evidence to implement effective care pathways and recommendations on the assessment and prevention of falls in older people. The amalgamation of the two guidelines has resulted in some disconnection. This article summarises the evidence and supports clinicians in the interpretation of the revised falls guideline.}

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine whether a brief intervention at the time of emergency department (ED) discharge can improve safe dosing of liquid acetaminophen and ibuprofen by parents or guardians. METHODS: We performed a randomized controlled trial in the ED of parents and guardians of children 90 days to 11.9 years of age who were discharged with acetaminophen or ibuprofen, or both. Families were randomized to standard care or a teaching intervention combining lay language, simplified handouts, provision of an unmarked dosing syringe, and teach-back to confirm correct dosing. Participants were called 48 to 72 hours and 5 to 7 days after ED discharge to assess understanding of correct dosing. The primary outcome was defined as parent or guardian report of safe dosing at the time of first follow-up call. Our primary hypothesis was that the intervention would decrease the rate of error from 30\% to 10\% at 48- to 72-hour follow-up. RESULTS: We enrolled 149 of 259 (58\%) eligible subjects; 97 of 149 (65\%) were reached at first follow-up call, of whom 35 of 97 (36\%) received the intervention. Among those participants receiving the intervention, 25 of 35 (71\%) were able to identify a safe dose for their child at the time of the first call compared with 28 of 62 (45\%) of those in the control arm. The difference in proportions was 26\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 7\% to 46\%). There was a 58\% increase in reporting safe dosing in the intervention group compared with the control roup (relative risk 1.58; 95\% CI 1.12 to 2.24), and it remained significant after adjustment for health literacy and language (adjusted relative risk 1.50; 95\% CI 1.06 to 2.13). CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted intervention at the time of ED discharge-consisting of a simplified dosing handout, a teaching session, teach-back, and provision of a standardized dosing device-can improve parents' knowledge of safe dosing of liquid medications at 48 to 72 hours.},

The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and perceptions about brain injury of family members of neurosurgical patients in our hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The participants (n=81) were relatives of patients admitted to the neurosurgery department between February and August 2016. They voluntarily completed a 19-item true-false format survey about brain injury based on a translation of other questionnaires used in previous studies from other countries (USA, Canada, UK, Ireland and New Zealand). Also, some sociodemographic data were collected (age, sex, education level and the patient's pathology). Data analysis was developed through graphical modelling with a regularisation parameter plotted on a network representing the association of the items of the questionnaire from the response pattern of participants. RESULTS: Data analysis showed two conceptual areas with a high rate of wrong answers: behaviour and management of patients, and expectations about acquired brain injury recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study would enable us to objectify misconceptions about acquired brain injury in patients' relatives attended in the neurosurgery department. This lack of knowledge could be a great obstacle in patients' recovery process. Therefore, we suggest placing the emphasis on the provision of information on brain injury to patients' families, especially with regard to its symptoms and course of development.},

DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. PATIENTS: 276 patients and 125 caregivers. Patients were 70 years and older and were placed in selected medical and surgical cardiac diagnostic-related groups. MEASUREMENTS: Group differences in patient outcomes (length of initial hospital stay, length of time between initial hospital discharge and readmission, and rehospitalization rates) and charges for care (charges for initial hospitalization, rehospitalizations, health services after discharge, and nurse specialist services) were measured 2, 6, and 12 weeks after discharge. RESULTS: From the initial hospital discharge to 6 weeks after discharge, patients in the medical intervention group had fewer readmissions, fewer total days rehospitalized, lower readmission charges, and lower charges for health care services after discharge. No differences in these outcomes were found between the surgical intervention and control groups during this period. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings support the need for comprehensive discharge planning designed for the elderly and implemented by nurse specialists to improve their outcomes after hospital discharge and to achieve cost savings. The findings also suggest that this intervention had its greatest effect in delaying or preventing rehospitalization of patients in the medical intervention group during the first 6 weeks after discharge.},

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of an advanced practice nurse-centered discharge planning and home follow-up intervention for elders at risk for hospital readmissions. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial with follow-up at 2, 6, 12, and 24 weeks after index hospital discharge. SETTING: Two urban, academically affiliated hospitals in Philadelphia, Pa. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible patients were 65 years or older, hospitalized between August 1992 and March 1996, and had 1 of several medical and surgical reasons for admission. INTERVENTION: Intervention group patients received a comprehensive discharge planning and home follow-up protocol designed specifically for elders at risk for poor outcomes after discharge and implemented by advanced practice nurses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Readmissions, time to first readmission, acute care visits after discharge, costs, functional status, depression, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 363 patients (186 in the control group and 177 in the intervention group) were enrolled in the study; 70\% of intervention and 74\% of control subjects completed the trial. Mean age of sample was 75 years; 50\% were men and 45\% were black. By week 24 after the index hospital discharge, control group patients were more likely than intervention group patients to be readmitted at least once (37.1 \% vs 20.3 \%; P{$<$}.001). Fewer intervention group patients had multiple readmissions (6.2\% vs 14.5\%; P = .01) and the intervention group had fewer hospital days per patient (1.53 vs 4.09 days; P{$<$}.001). Time to first readmission was increased in the intervention group (P{$<$}.001). At 24 weeks after discharge, total Medicare reimbursements for health services were about \$1.2 million in the control group vs about \$0.6 million in the intervention group (P{$<$}.001). There were no significant group differences in post-discharge acute care visits, functional status, depression, or patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: An advanced practice nurse-centered discharge planning and home care intervention for at-risk hospitalized elders reduced readmissions, lengthened the time between discharge and readmission, and decreased the costs of providing health care. Thus, the intervention demonstrated great potential in promoting positive outcomes for hospitalized elders at high risk for rehospitalization while reducing costs.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of translating into a large US health plan, the Transitional Care Model (TCM), an evidence-based approach to address the needs of chronically ill older adults throughout acute episodes of illness. METHODS: A prospective, quasi-experimental study of 172 at-risk Aetna Medicare Advantage members in the mid-Atlantic region who received the TCM. A baseline and post-intervention (average of 2 months) comparison of enrolees' health status and quality of life was conducted. Member and physician satisfaction were assessed within 1 month post intervention. Health resource utilization and cost outcomes were compared to a matched control group of Aetna members at multiple intervals through 1 year. RESULTS: Improvements in all health status and quality of life measures were observed post- intervention compared to pre-intervention. Among 155 stringently matched pairs, a significant decrease in number of re-hospitalizations (45 vs. 60, P {$<$} 0.041) and total hospital days (252 vs. 351, P {$<$} 0.032) were observed at 3 months. Reductions in other utilization outcomes or time points were not statistically significant. The TCM was associated with a short-term decrease of \$439 per member per month in total health care costs at 3 months and cumulative per member savings of \$2170 at 1 year (P {$<$} 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrate that a rigorously tested model of transitional care for chronically ill older adults can be successfully translated into a real-world organization and achieve higher value.},

These challenges are magnified for older adults who receive long-term services and supports. The Affordable Care Act attempts to address some of these challenges. We analyzed three provisions of the act: the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program; the National Pilot Program on Payment Bundling; and the Community-Based Care Transitions Program. These three provisions were designed to enhance care transitions for the broader population of adults coping with chronic illness. We found that these provisions inadequately address the unique needs of vulnerable subgroup members who require long-term services and supports and, in some instances, could produce unintended consequences that would contribute to avoidable poor outcomes. We recommend that policy makers anticipate such unintended consequences and advance payment policies that integrate care. They should also prepare the delivery system to keep up with new requirements under the Affordable Care Act, by supporting providers in implementing evidence-based transitional care practices, recrafting strategic and operational plans, developing educational and other resources for frail older adults and their family caregivers, and integrating measurement and reporting requirements into performance systems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the global targets for non-communicable diseases is to halt, by 2025, the rise in the age-standardised adult prevalence of diabetes at its 2010 levels. We aimed to estimate worldwide trends in diabetes, how likely it is for countries to achieve the global target, and how changes in prevalence, together with population growth and ageing, are affecting the number of adults with diabetes. METHODS: We pooled data from population-based studies that had collected data on diabetes through measurement of its biomarkers. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends in diabetes prevalence-defined as fasting plasma glucose of 7.0 mmol/L or higher, or history of diagnosis with diabetes, or use of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs-in 200 countries and territories in 21 regions, by sex and from 1980 to 2014. We also calculated the posterior probability of meeting the global diabetes target if post-2000 trends continue. FINDINGS: We used data from 751 studies including 4,372,000 adults from 146 of the 200 countries we make estimates for. Global age-standardised diabetes prevalence increased from 4.3\% (95\% credible interval 2.4-7.0) in 1980 to 9.0\% (7.2-11.1) in 2014 in men, and from 5.0\% (2.9-7.9) to 7.9\% (6.4-9.7) in women. The number of adults with diabetes in the world increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 (28.5\% due to the rise in prevalence, 39.7\% due to population growth and ageing, and 31.8\% due to interaction of these two factors). Age-standardised adult diabetes prevalence in 2014 was lowest in northwestern Europe, and highest in Polynesia and Micronesia, at nearly 25\%, followed by Melanesia and the Middle East and north Africa. Between 1980 and 2014 there was little change in age-standardised diabetes prevalence in adult women in continental western Europe, although crude prevalence rose because of ageing of the population. By contrast, age-standardised adult prevalence rose by 15 percentage points in men and women in Polynesia and Micronesia. In 2014, American Samoa had the highest national prevalence of diabetes ({$>$}30\% in both sexes), with age-standardised adult prevalence also higher than 25\% in some other islands in Polynesia and Micronesia. If post-2000 trends continue, the probability of meeting the global target of halting the rise in the prevalence of diabetes by 2025 at the 2010 level worldwide is lower than 1\% for men and is 1\% for women. Only nine countries for men and 29 countries for women, mostly in western Europe, have a 50\% or higher probability of meeting the global target. INTERPRETATION: Since 1980, age-standardised diabetes prevalence in adults has increased, or at best remained unchanged, in every country. Together with population growth and ageing, this rise has led to a near quadrupling of the number of adults with diabetes worldwide. The burden of diabetes, both in terms of prevalence and number of adults affected, has increased faster in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.

METHODS: A  prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted at the University of Abuja  Teaching Hospital from April 2016 to May 2017. Maternal-neonatal pairs were  screened for ESBL-E exposure at time of delivery. Neonatal mortality was assessed  at 28~days. RESULTS: A total of 1161 singleton deliveries were evaluated. In  total, 9.7\% (113/1161) of mothers and 4.3\% (50/1161) of infants had  ESBL-E-positive cultures at delivery. Maternal antibiotic exposure was associated  with ESBL-E recto-vaginal colonization (18.6\% (21/113) vs. 8.4\% (88/1048),  p~{$<~$}0.001)). Maternal ESBL-E colonization (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 14.85; 95\%  CI 7.83-28.15) and vaginal delivery (AOR 6.35; 95\% CI 2.63-17.1) were identified  as a risk factor for positive ESBL-E neonatal surface cultures. Neonatal positive  ESBL-E surface cultures were a risk factor for neonatal mortality (stillbirths  included, AOR 4.84; 95\% CI 1.44-16.31). The finding that maternal ESBL-E  recto-vaginal colonization appeared protective in regards to neonatal mortality  (AOR 0.22; 95\% CI .06-0.75) requires further evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal  ESBL-E recto-vaginal colonization is an independent risk factor for neonatal  ESBL-E colonization and neonates with positive ESBL-E surface cultures were  identified as having increased risk of neonatal mortality.},

  abstract = {There is a lack of knowledge about the influence of individual physical activities on the quality of life (QoL) of older adults, especially in strength training and swimming, two popular activities. OBJECTIVES: To assess and compare the perceived QoL levels among sedentary, swimming and strength training groups in elderly individuals. METHODS: Twenty one subjects were evaluated: 9 sedentary, 10 swimming and 12 strength training. Physical activity levels were assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short version, and the physical, psychological, social and environmental domains, as well the general QoL of each group, were assessed through the World Health Organization questionnaire short version. In addition, the contribution of each domain in general QoL was also verified. RESULTS: The sedentary group presented a statistically lower score in each variable examined (p{$<$}0.05). The physical domain was higher only in the strength training group and the psychological and social domains were higher only in the swimming group. In relation to the influence on general QoL, the physical domain (i.e., sedentary); the physical and psychological domains (i.e., swimming) and the social and environmental domains (i.e., strength training) were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the QoL levels were always lower in the sedentary group. However, the determination of the domain depended on the physical activity level of each subject. Further, the domains with better scores were not necessarily the ones that showed a higher association with the general QoL in each group.},

Little is known about the association between available skilled nursing facility (SNF) performance measures and the risk of hospital readmission. OBJECTIVE: To measure the association between SNF performance measures and hospital readmissions among Medicare beneficiaries receiving postacute care at SNFs in the United States. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Using national Medicare data on fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries discharged to a SNF after an acute care hospitalization between September 1, 2009, and August 31, 2010, we examined the association between SNF performance on publicly available metrics (SNF staffing intensity, health deficiencies identified through site inspections, and the percentages of SNF patients with delirium, moderate to severe pain, and new or worsening pressure ulcers) and the risk of readmission or death 30 days after discharge to a SNF. Adjusted analyses controlled for patient case mix, SNF facility factors, and the discharging hospital. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Readmission to an acute care hospital or death within 30 days of the index hospital discharge. RESULTS: Of 1,530,824 patients discharged, 357,752 (23.3\%; 99\% CI, 23.3\%-23.5\%) were readmitted or died within 30 days; 72,472 died within 30 days (4.7\%; 99\% CI, 4.7\%-4.8\%), and 321,709 were readmitted (21.0\%; 99\% CI, 20.9\%-21.1\%). The unadjusted risk of readmission or death was lower at SNFs with better staffing ratings. SNFs ranked lowest (19.2\% of all SNFs) had a 30-day risk of readmission or death of 25.5\% (99\% CI, 25.3\%-25.8\%) vs 19.8\% (99\% CI, 19.5\%-20.1\%) among those ranked highest. SNFs with better facility inspection ratings also had a lower risk of readmission or death. SNFs ranked lowest (20.1\% of all SNFs) had a risk of 24.9\% (99\% CI, 24.7\%-25.1\%) vs 21.5\% (99\% CI, 21.2\%-21.7\%) among those ranked highest . Adjustment for patient factors, SNF facility factors, and the discharging hospital attenuated these associations; we observed small differences in the adjusted risk of readmission or death according to SNF facility inspection ratings (lowest vs highest rating: 23.7\%; 99\% CI: 23.7\%, 23.7\%; vs 23.0\%; 99\% CI: 23.0\%, 23.1\%). Other measures did not predict clinically meaningful differences in the adjusted risk of readmission or death. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries discharged to a SNF after an acute care hospitalization, available performance measures were not consistently associated with differences in the adjusted risk of readmission or death.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the prevalence of cavitated dental caries and oral health literacy (OHL), family characteristics and sociodemographic factors in early adolescence. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 740 twelve-year-old students. The students' guardians provided information on sociodemographic data, and the students provided information on family characteristics and OHL. Two trained dentists examined the participants for dental caries and administered the Brazilian version of the Rapid Estimate of Oral Health Literacy in Dentistry (BREALD-30). Control variables were selected using a directed acyclic graph. Descriptive analysis was performed; this was followed by robust Poisson regression analysis for complex samples to evaluate the association between dental caries and socioeconomic and family predictors ({$\alpha~$}=~5\%). RESULTS: The following variables were associated with a greater number of cavitated caries lesions: low level of education completed by the mother (RR~=~1.58; 95\% CI: 1.12-2.24), less privileged social class (RR~=~1.89; 95\% CI: 1.28-2.80), non-White ethnicity (RR~=~1.64; 95\% CI: 1.0-2.48), larger number of residents in the home (RR~=~1.87; 95\% CI: 1.25-2.81), low level of OHL (RR~=~2.02; 95\% CI: 1.28-3.18), and the 'connected' (RR~=~4.72; 95\% CI: 1.17-18.90), 'separated' (RR~=~4.09; 95\% CI: 1.05-15.86) and 'disengaged' (RR~=~4.20; 95\% CI: 1.09-16.18) types of family cohesion. CONCLUSIONS: A low level of oral health literacy, sociodemographic factors, and a low level of family cohesion are predictors of cavitated caries lesions in early adolescence.},

AIM: To evaluate the influence of oral health literacy and sociodemographic, clinical, and family factors on dental visits among early adolescents. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 740 12-year-old students in Campina Grande, Brazil. Students answered about their level of oral health literacy (BREALD-30), levels of family adaptability and cohesion (FACES III), and visits to the dentist sometime in life. Dental caries experience was evaluated using Nyvad criteria. Robust Poisson regression for complex samples was performed. RESULTS: A higher level of oral health literacy (PR~=~1.01; 95\% CI: 1.01-1.03), high social class (PR~=~1.28; 95\% CI: 1.09-1.50), higher mother's schooling (PR~=~1.58; 95\% CI: 1.37-1.83), family cohesion classified as enmeshed (PR~=~1.55; 95\% CI: 1.19-2.02) and connected (PR~=~1.22; 95\% CI: 1.02-1.44), and the absence of toothache (PR~=~1.18; 95\% CI: 1.01-1.38) remained associated with having visited a dentist.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with health literacy in multimorbid patients. DESIGN: A nationwide cross-sectional study in Switzerland. Univariate and multivariate linear regressions were calculated to identify variables associated with health literacy. A multiple imputation approach was used to deal with missing values. PARTICIPANTS: Multimorbid patients recruited in primary care settings (n=888), above 18 years old and suffering from at least 3 of 75 chronic conditions on a predefined list based on the International Classification of Primary Care 2. MAIN MEASURES: Health literacy was assessed using the European Health Literacy Survey project questionnaire (HLS-EU 6). This comprises six items scored from 1 to 4 (very difficult=1, fairly difficult=2, fairly easy=3, very easy=4), and the total health literacy score is computed as their mean. As we wished to understand the determinants associated with lower health literacy, the HLS-EU 6 score was the only dependent variable; all other covariates were considered independent. RESULTS: The mean health literacy score (SD) was 2.9 (0.5). Multivariate analyses found significant associations between low health literacy scores and treatment burden scores ({$\beta$}=-0.004, 95\%\,CI -0.006 to 0.002); marital status, predominantly the divorced group ({$\beta$}=0.136, 95\%\,CI 0.012 to 0.260); dimensions of the EuroQuol 5 Dimension 3 Level (EQ5D3L) quality of life assessment, that is, for moderate problems with mobility ({$\beta$}=-0.086, 95\%\,CI -0.157 to 0.016); and with moderate problems ({$\beta$}=-0.129, 95\%\,CI -0.198 to 0.060) and severe problems with anxiety/depression ({$\beta$}=-0.343, 95\%\,CI -0.500 to 0.186). CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbid patients with a high treatment burden, altered quality of life by problems with mobility, anxiety or depression, often also have low levels of health literacy. Primary care practitioners should therefore pay particular attention to these patients in their daily practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Self-help groups (SHGs) are an inherent part of patient involvement and play an important role in the healthcare system. Until now, however, there has been a~lack of systematic investigations and quantitative data about the individual impact of self-help for patients and relatives. OBJECTIVES: This study presents the results of a~comparison between members of SHGs and non-members. Thereby, the effects of self-help shall be described in terms of empowerment and self-management. The study is part of the project "Health-related Collective Self-Help in Germany" (Gesundheitsbezogene Selbsthilfe in Deutschland-SHILD) funded by the Federal Ministry of Health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted with patients from five therapeutic areas (diabetes mellitus type~2, prostate cancer, multiple sclerosis, tinnitus, relatives of dementia patients). Participants administered a~multidimensional questionnaire (paper-and-pencil or online). Of the 2870 participants in this analysis, 49\% were active members of SHGs. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed some significant, but small differences between the two groups in five out of seven~scales of the Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ) in favour of the SHG members. Furthermore, SHG members performed better in specific knowledge tests. Members see the importance of their group especially in social inclusion, psychosocial relief, coping with the disease and new insights in dealing with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to the study design we cannot rule out that differences might be based on personal characteristics influencing the decision to participate in a~SHG or not. But as the results are controlled for confounders, the hypothesis that SHG participation has a~positive impact on the outcomes rather than vice versa seems supported.},

Participants were adults aged 18 years or older admitted for 48 hours or longer from January 1, 2017, to August 31, 2020. Statistical analysis was performed from November 2022 to April 2024.Patient race and rurality status were defined as the combination of race (Black or White) and residence (urban or rural per patient zip code).HAI was defined as a positive culture from a urine, blood, or respiratory specimen obtained 48 hours or longer after admission. To determine the association of race and rurality with HAIs, multivariable generalized estimating equations models were used to account for clustering of admissions by patient. Among patients with HAI admissions, similar models examined post-HAI intensive care unit admission and in-hospital death.Among 214\,955 patients admitted to the hospital (median [IQR] age, 63 [51-73] years; 108\,679 female patients [50.6\%]; 72\,490 Black patients [33.7\%]; 142\,465 White patients [66.3\%]), recognized HAIs occurred during 6699 (3.1\%). Compared with White urban patients, Black urban patients had a decreased risk of HAI (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 0.81; 95\% CI, 0.75-0.87), White rural patients had an increased risk of HAI (aRR, 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.20), and Black rural patients (aRR, 1.08; 95\% CI, 0.81-1.44) had a similar risk of HAI. Among patients with HAI admissions, Black rural patients had an increased risk of intensive care unit admission (aRR, 1.92; 95\% CI, 1.16-3.17) and in-hospital death (aRR, 1.78; 95\% CI, 1.26-2.50). White rural and Black urban patients had outcomes similar to those of White urban patients.This cohort study of hospitalized adults identified inequities related to race and rurality in HAIs and adverse outcomes from HAIs. These findings suggest that factors such as structural racism and disinvestment in rural communities may be associated with individual HAI risk and post-HAI outcomes. Future work to further understand the reasons underpinning these disparities and methods to address structural factors through policy and process changes are critical to eliminate health inequities.},

Included were all those patients who had been admitted to the hospital from their home several (mean: five) times between 1987 and 1990 (48 women, 19 men; mean age 81.3 +/- 7.2 years--a total of 331 re-admissions). The most frequent diagnoses were heart failure (38.8\%), acute cerebrovascular accident or its sequelae (31.3\%), dementia (23.9\%), fall or its sequelae (22.3\%) and diabetes (20.9\%). Of the 331 re-admissions 87 (26.3\%) occurred during the first 3 weeks after discharge. The most important reasons of this early re-admissions were inadequate home care (41.4\%), undesirable drug effects and non-compliance (25.3\%), as well as rapid progression of the basic disease (14.9\%). In the judgement of the hospital team more than 40\% of the early re-admissions were avoidable, among those re-admitted because of inadequate home care and those in connection with drug intake even more than half. Early hospitalization is frequently avoidable, if individual geriatric assessment is undertaken and discharge carefully planned.},

METHODS: The Northern Sweden MONICA Project population surveys were performed in 1994 and 1999. A cohort of 1,254 subjects participating in both surveys answered questions about experiences of disease, perceived health, marital status, psychosocial factors, and Antonovsky's SOC scale with 13 items. RESULTS: The mean SOC score showed a decrease in the five-year follow-up and those with identified disease and the oldest age group (45-74 years) had the largest decrease of the SOC score. People with the lowest SOC scores in 1994 had the largest decrease during the period. Men and women shared a similar pattern regarding the decrease in SOC over time. The impact of individual social changes during the study period showed that both men and women who had experienced loss of perceived good health and high social support had the largest decrease. Furthermore, women seemed to be more affected by changes than men. CONCLUSIONS: We found that SOC was only stable for those with initially high levels of SOC. For other people, individual conditions and societal changes influenced their SOC. Further longitudinal studies in normal populations are needed to investigate the stability of SOC scores.},

AIM: This study was carried out to determine whether the offer of a telephone helpline on oral health and dementia would be utilized. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Over a period of 1 year contacts received by a telephone helpline manned by three oral healthcare staff were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: From 01 June 2012 to 31 May 2013 a total of 355 callers (180 healthcare staff and 175 relatives) presented and discussed 2535 problems. The average duration of a call was 21~min. Almost one quarter of the callers were looking for mobile dental care services and 14.4\,\% were looking for a dentist specialized in caring for patients with dementia. Oral disease, oral care and conflicts between stakeholders on aspects of oral health were discussed. Of the healthcare staff three quarters asked about training to improve the oral health of people with dementia. CONCLUSION: The demand on the specialists of the helpline showed a substantial knowledge deficit of healthcare staff and relatives. The study confirmed a wide range of oral health issues of people with dementia. Knowledge on oral and denture hygiene and on oral disease could be introduced into primary training and continued professional education. In addition to the lack of knowledge, deficits also exist in the oral healthcare system for people with dementia. Politicians and healthcare stakeholders are encouraged to incorporate oral healthcare for people with dementia into strategies and dementia networks.},

In Rwanda, nearly 71\% of neonatal deaths are  preventable and among these, 10\% are due to neonatal sepsis. Nevertheless,  limited information exists on neonatal sepsis and its associated factors in  Rwanda. The objectives of the study were to find prevalence and factors  associated with neonatal sepsis among neonates admitted in Kibungo Referral  Hospital, Ngoma District, Rwanda. We used a retrospective cross-sectional study  design reviewing a subset of neonatal, maternal and laboratory records from  Kibungo Hospital in 2017. Data were reviewed and collected from March to May,  2018. Logistic regression and odds ratios were calculated to identify the factors  associated with neonatal sepsis at 95\% CI, p\,{$<$}\,0.05. Of the 972 total neonates'  medical records from 2017, we randomly selected 422 of which 12.8\% (n\,=\,54) had  neonatal sepsis. When blood cultures were positive, 62\% grew Klebsiella  pneumoniae. Among neonates with sepsis, 38 (70\%) recovered while 16 (30\%) died.  Neonatal sepsis was strongly associated with neonatal age less than or equal to  three days (aOR: 2.769, 95\% CI 1.312-5.843; p\,=\,0.008); and gestational age less  than 37~weeks (aOR: 4.149; CI 1.1878-9.167; p\,{$\leq$}\,0.001). Increased use of blood  cultures including sensitivity testing, routine surface cultures of the  neonatology and maternity wards facilities, and systematic ward cleaning are all  important approaches to prevent and treat neonatal infections in additional to  regular neonatal sepsis evaluations.},

METHODS: Thirty-eight internal medicine wards in Italy participated in the Registro Politerapie SIMI (REPOSI) study during 2008. One thousand three hundred and thirty-two in-patients aged {$>$}/=65 years were enrolled. Polypharmacy was defined as the concomitant use of five or more medications. Linear regression analyses were used to evaluate predictors of length of hospital stay and logistic regression models for predictors of in-hospital mortality. Age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, polypharmacy, and number of in-hospital clinical adverse events (AEs) were used as possible confounders. RESULTS: The prevalence of polypharmacy was 51.9\% at hospital admission and 67.0\% at discharge. Age, number of drugs at admission, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were independently associated with polypharmacy at discharge. In multivariate analysis, the occurrence of at least one AE while in hospital was the only predictor of prolonged hospitalization (each new AE prolonged hospital stay by 3.57 days, p {$<$} 0.0001). Age [odds ratio (OR) 1.04; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.08; p = 0.02), comorbidities (OR 1.18; 95\% CI 1.12-1.24; p {$<$} 0.0001), and AEs (OR 6.80; 95\% CI 3.58-12.9; p {$<$} 0.0001) were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Although most elderly in-patients receive polypharmacy, in this study, it was not associated with any hospital outcome. However, AEs were strongly correlated with a longer hospital stay and higher mortality risk.},

  abstract = {The pattern of patients admitted to internal medicine wards has dramatically changed in the last 20--30 years. Elderly people are now the most rapidly growing proportion of the patient population in the majority of Western countries, and aging seldom comes alone, often being accompanied by chronic diseases, comorbidity, disability, frailty, and social isolation. Multiple diseases and multimorbidity inevitably lead to the use of multiple drugs, a condition known as polypharmacy. Over the last 20--30 years, problems related to aging, multimorbidity, and polypharmacy have become a prominent issue in global healthcare. This review discusses how internists might tackle these new challenges of the aging population. They are called to play a primary role in promoting a new, integrated, and comprehensive approach to the care of elderly people, which should incorporate age-related issues into routine clinical practice and decisions. The development of new approaches in the frame of undergraduate and postgraduate training and of clinical research is essential to improve and implement suitable strategies meant to evaluate and manage frail elderly patients with chronic diseases, comorbidity, and polypharmacy.},

From this perspective, health education is directed towards improving health literacy. This paper identifies the failings of past educational programs to address social and economic determinants of health, and traces the subsequent reduction in the role of health education in contemporary health promotion. These perceived failings may have led to significant underestimation of the potential role of health education in addressing the social determinants of health. A `health outcome model' is presented. This model highlights health literacy as a key outcome from health education. Examination of the concept of health literacy identifies distinctions between functional health literacy, interactive health literacy and critical health literacy. Through this analysis, improving health literacy meant more than transmitting information, and developing skills to be able to read pamphlets and successfully make appointments. By improving people's access to health information and their capacity to use it effectively, it is argued that improved health literacy is critical to empowerment. The implications for the content and method of contemporary health education and communication are then considered. Emphasis is given to more personal forms of communication, and community-based educational outreach, as well as the political content of health education, focussed on better equipping people to overcome structural barriers to health.},

  abstract = {The relationship between poor literacy skills and health status is now well recognized and better understood. Interest in this relationship has led to the emergence of the concept of health literacy. The concept has emerged from two different roots -- in clinical care and in public health. This paper describes the two distinctive concepts that reflect health literacy, respectively, as a clinical ``risk'', or a personal ``asset''. In the former case a strong science is developing to support screening for poor literacy skills in clinical care and this is leading to a range of changes to clinical practice and organization. The conceptualization of health literacy as an asset has its roots in educational research into literacy, concepts of adult learning, and health promotion. The science to support this conceptualization is less well developed and is focused on the development of skills and capacities intended to enable people to exert greater control over their health and the factors that shape health. The paper concludes that both conceptualizations are important and are helping to stimulate a more sophisticated understanding of the process of health communication in both clinical and community settings, as well as highlighting factors impacting on its effectiveness. These include more personal forms of communication and community based educational outreach. It recommends improved interaction between researchers working within the two health literacy perspectives, and further research on the measurement of health literacy. The paper also emphasizes the importance of more general strategies to promote literacy, numeracy and language skills in populations.},

Existing interventions demonstrate the feasibility of improving health literacy among higher-risk populations, but research remains underdeveloped and effects on health inequity are largely untested.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether primary care physicians in the same physician practice collectively see enough Medicare patients annually to detect meaningful differences between practices in ambulatory quality and cost measures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Primary care physicians in the United States were linked to their physician practices using the Healthcare Organization Services database maintained by IMS Health. Patients who visited primary care physicians in the 2005 Medicare Part B 20\% sample were used to estimate Medicare caseloads per practice. Caseloads necessary to detect 10\% relative differences in costs and quality were calculated using national mean ambulatory Medicare spending, rates of mammography for women 66 to 69 years, and hemoglobin A(1c) testing for 66- to 75-year-olds with diabetes, preventable hospitalization rate, and 30-day readmission rate after discharge for congestive heart failure (CHF). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of primary care physician practices with a sufficient number of eligible patients to detect a 10\% relative difference in each performance measure. RESULTS: Primary care physician practices had annual median caseloads of 260 Medicare patients (interquartile range [IQR], 135-500), 25 women eligible for mammography (IQR, 10-50), 30 patients with diabetes eligible for hemoglobin A(1c) testing (IQR, 15-55), and 0 patients hospitalized for CHF. For ambulatory costs, mammography rate, and hemoglobin A(1c) testing rate, the percentage of primary care physician practices with sufficient caseloads to detect 10\% relative differences in performance ranged from less than 10\% of practices with fewer than 11 primary care physicians to 100\% of practices with more than 50 primary care physicians. None of the primary care physician practices had sufficient caseloads to detect 10\% relative differences in preventable hospitalization or 30-day readmission after discharge for CHF. CONCLUSION: Relatively few primary care physician practices are large enough to reliably measure 10\% relative differences in common measures of quality and cost performance among fee-for-service Medicare patients.},

It has also become evident that antimicrobial resistance is a problem that cannot be tackled by single institutions or physicians. Prevention of antimicrobial resistance needs rigorous actions at ward level, institution level, national level and at supra-national levels. Countries can learn from each other and possibly transplant best practices across borders to prevent antimicrobial resistance. The aim of this study is to highlight some of the success stories of proven cost-effective interventions, and to describe the actions that have been taken, the outcomes that have been found, and the difficulties that have been met. In some cases we came across substantial scope for real-life cost savings. Although the best approach to effectively hinder the spread of antimicrobial resistance remains unclear and may vary significantly among settings, several EU-wide examples demonstrate that cost-effective antimicrobial stewardship is possible. Such examples can encourage others to implement (the most cost-effective) elements in their system.},

  abstract = {Inappropriate prescribing is highly prevalent in older people and is a major healthcare concern because of its association with negative healthcare outcomes including adverse drug events, related morbidity and hospitalization. With changing population demographics resulting in increasing proportions of older people worldwide, improving the quality and safety of prescribing in older people poses a global challenge. To date a number of different strategies have been used to identify potentially inappropriate prescribing in older people. Over the last two decades, a number of criteria have been published to assist prescribers in detecting inappropriate prescribing, the majority of which have been explicit sets of criteria, though some are implicit. The majority of these prescribing indicators pertain to overprescribing and misprescribing, with only a minority focussing on the underprescribing of indicated medicines. Additional interventions to optimize prescribing in older people include comprehensive geriatric assessment, clinical pharmacist review, and education of prescribers as well as computerized prescribing with clinical decision support systems. In this review, we describe the inappropriate prescribing detection tools or criteria most frequently cited in the literature and examine their role in preventing inappropriate prescribing and other related healthcare outcomes. We also discuss other measures commonly used in the detection and prevention of inappropriate prescribing in older people and the evidence supporting their use and their application in everyday clinical practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal Sepsis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates despite great advances in antimicrobial therapy and life support  measures. OBJECTIVES: To compare the aetiology, risk factors, presentation and  outcomes of care between early onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) and late onset  neonatal sepsis (LOS). METHODS: Bacterial isolates were identified using blood  cultures and antibiotic susceptibility testing was done using disc diffusion  method. The risk factors, clinical presentation, laboratory findings and neonatal  outcomes of the babies with EOS were compared with LOS. Statistical significance  was set at P {$<$}0.05. RESULTS: Neonatal Sepsis was responsible for 16\% of Special  Care Baby Unit (SCBU) admissions. Of the 72 babies with sepsis, 56 (77.8\%) had  EOS as against 16 (22.2\%) who had late-onset sepsis. Low birth weight (p=0.01)  and perinatal asphyxia (p=0.01) were significantly associated with EOS while for  LOS, delivery outside the health facility (p=0.01) was the only significant risk  factor. Respiratory distress was more significantly observed in EOS (p = 0.01).  Neonatal deaths occurred in 32\% of babies with EOS while all babies with culture  positive LOS survived. CONCLUSION: Early onset neonatal sepsis is associated with  high likelihood of neonatal mortality. Unsupervised delivery, birth asphyxia and  low birth weight are risk factors associated with neonatal sepsis. Efforts to  ensure supervised hospital delivery and improvement in neonatal resuscitation may  reduce the incidence of neonatal sepsis and its attendant complications.},

CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 26-day-old neonate who was  admitted with a day history of fever, poor feeding, pre-auricular lymphadenopathy  and sudden parental death. He was initially evaluated for late onset neonatal  sepsis. He later developed abnormal bleeding and multiple convulsions while on  admission, prompting the need to evaluate for Lassa fever using reverse  transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). He died 31\,h into admission and  RT-PCR result was positive for Lassa fever. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal Lassa fever  infection is highly fatal and can mimic neonatal sepsis. High index of suspicion  is needed particularly for atypical presentations of neonatal sepsis in Lassa  fever endemic areas.},

The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge regarding antibiotic use and resistance among pre-final year and final year medical school students of Ebonyi State University, Nigeria. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among all the 184 pre-final and final year medical students of the College of Medicine at Ebonyi State University, Nigeria. Information was collected in April 2018 using a semi-structured, self-administered questionnaire and data were analysed with Epi-Info Version 7.2. Analytical decisions were considered significant at P {$<$} 0.05. Results: Respondents were mostly males (62.5\%), aged 20-29 years (68.9\%) with 60.9\% of them in the final year class. Eighty-seven percent of them desired more education on antibiotic use and resistance. Majority 119 (64.7\%) respondents had good knowledge of antibiotic use and resistance, however, 39\% incorrectly answered that bacteria cause common cold. Only 103 (56.0\%) of them had positive practice of antibiotic use. While 8.2\% of respondents always consulted a doctor before starting an antibiotic. 37.2\% of them never discarded their remaining leftover medications. Knowledge was associated with respondent's gender (P=0.035) while practice was associated with the class of study (P{$<$}0.001). Conclusion: There was good knowledge of antibiotic use and resistance, however, practice levels were poor. There is need to enrich existing courses and training about antibiotic use in the curriculum of the medical schools with more emphasis on antimicrobial stewardship.},

Scholars note that these patterns may be related to women over-reporting and men under-reporting health problems, but gender differences in reporting behaviors have not been rigorously tested. Using Wave 1 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), the present study investigates the extent to which adjusting for differences in reporting behavior modifies gender differences in general health. We also examine whether men and women's reporting behaviors are consistent across different levels of education. After adjusting for reporting heterogeneity, gender differences in both poor and good health widened. However, we found no clear gender-specific patterns in reporting either poor or good health. Our findings also do not provide convincing evidence that education is an important determinant of general health reporting, although the female disadvantage in poor health and the male advantage in good health were more apparent in lower than higher education groups at all ages. The results challenge prevailing stereotypes that women over-report and men under-report health problems and highlight the importance of attending to health problems reported by women and men with equal care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Under-five mortality in Kenya has declined over the past two decades. However, the reduction in the neonatal mortality rate has remained stagnant. In a  country with weak civil registration and vital statistics systems, there is an  evident gap in documentation of mortality and its causes among low birth weight  (LBW) and preterm neonates. We aimed to establish causes of neonatal LBW and  preterm mortality in Migori County, among participants of the PTBI-K (Preterm  Birth Initiative-Kenya) study. METHODS: Verbal and social autopsy (VASA)  interviews were conducted with caregivers of deceased LBW and preterm neonates  delivered within selected 17 health facilities in Migori County, Kenya. The  probable cause of death was assigned using the WHO International Classification  of Diseases (ICD-10). RESULTS: Between January 2017 to December 2018, 3175 babies  were born preterm or LBW, and 164 (5.1\%) died in the first 28~days of life. VASA  was conducted among 88 (53.7\%) of the neonatal deaths. Almost half (38, 43.2\%) of  the deaths occurred within the first 24~h of life. Birth asphyxia (45.5\%),  neonatal sepsis (26.1\%), respiratory distress syndrome (12.5\%) and hypothermia  (11.0\%) were the leading causes of death. In the early neonatal period, majority  (54.3\%) of the neonates succumbed to asphyxia while in the late neonatal period  majority (66.7\%) succumbed to sepsis. Delay in seeking medical care was reported  for 4 (5.8\%) of the neonatal deaths. CONCLUSION: Deaths among LBW and preterm  neonates occur early in life due to preventable causes. This calls for enhanced  implementation of existing facility-based intrapartum and immediate postpartum  care interventions, targeting asphyxia, sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome and  hypothermia.},

However, antibiotic use can be distributed in different ways in a population, and the association between the distribution of use and antibiotic resistance has not been explored. Here, we tested the hypothesis that repeated use of antibiotics has a stronger association with population-wide antibiotic resistance than broadly-distributed, low-intensity use. First, we characterized the distribution of outpatient antibiotic use across US states, finding that antibiotic use is uneven and that repeated use of antibiotics makes up a minority of antibiotic use. Second, we compared antibiotic use with resistance for 72 pathogen-antibiotic combinations across states. Finally, having partitioned total use into extensive and intensive margins, we found that intense use had a weaker association with resistance than extensive use. If the use-resistance relationship is causal, these results suggest that reducing total use and selection intensity will require reducing broadly distributed, low-intensity use.},

  abstract = {Antibiotic use is a key driver of antibiotic resistance. Understanding the quantitative association between antibiotic use and resulting resistance is important for predicting future rates of antibiotic resistance and for designing antibiotic stewardship policy. However, the use-resistance association is complicated by "spillover," in which one population's level of antibiotic use affects another population's level of resistance via the transmission of bacteria between those populations. Spillover is known to have effects at the level of families and hospitals, but it is unclear if spillover is relevant at larger scales. We used mathematical modeling and analysis of observational data to address this question. First, we used dynamical models of antibiotic resistance to predict the effects of spillover. Whereas populations completely isolated from one another do not experience any spillover, we found that if even 1\% of interactions are between populations, then spillover may have large consequences: The effect of a change in antibiotic use in one population on antibiotic resistance in that population could be reduced by as much as 50\%. Then, we quantified spillover in observational antibiotic use and resistance data from US states and European countries for three pathogen-antibiotic combinations, finding that increased interactions between populations were associated with smaller differences in antibiotic resistance between those populations. Thus, spillover may have an important impact at the level of states and countries, which has ramifications for predicting the future of antibiotic resistance, designing antibiotic resistance stewardship policy, and interpreting stewardship interventions.},

  abstract = {In low-income and middle-income countries, courses of antibiotics are routinely given to term newborns whose mothers had prolonged rupture of membranes (PROM).  Rational antibiotic use is vital given rising rates of antimicrobial resistance  and potential adverse effects of antibiotic exposure in newborns. However missing  cases of sepsis can be life-threatening.This is a quality improvement evaluation  of a protocol for minimal or no antibiotics in term babies born after PROM in  Papua New Guinea. Asymptomatic, term babies born to women with PROM {$>$}12\,hours  prior to birth were given a stat dose of antibiotics, or no antibiotics if the  mother had received intrapartum antibiotics, reviewed and discharged at  48-72\,hours with follow-up. Clinical signs of sepsis within the first week and  the neonatal period were assessed. Of 170 newborns whose mothers had PROM, 133  were assessed at 7 days: signs of sepsis occurred in 10 babies (7.5\%; 95\% CI 4.4\%  to 13.2\%) in the first week. Five had isolated fever, four had skin pustules and  one had fever with periumbilical erythema. An additional four (3\%) had any sign  of sepsis between 8 and 28 days. There was one case of bacteraemia and no deaths.  37 were lost to follow-up, but hospital records did not identify any subsequent  admissions for infection. A rate of sepsis was documented that was comparable  with other studies in low-income countries. This protocol may reduce  antimicrobial resistance and consequences of antibiotic exposure in newborns,  provided safeguards are in place to monitor for signs of sepsis.},

  abstract = {Hypertension in older adults is related to adverse cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death. The global burden of hypertension is increasing due to an aging population and increasing prevalence of obesity, and is estimated to affect one third of the world's population by 2025. Adverse outcomes in older adults are compounded by mechanical hemodynamic changes, arterial stiffness, neurohormonal and autonomic dysregulation, and declining renal function. This review highlights the current evidence and summarizes recent guidelines on hypertension, pertaining to older adults. Management strategies for hypertension in older adults must consider the degree of frailty, increasingly complex medical comorbidities, and psycho-social factors, and must therefore be individualized. Non-pharmacological lifestyle interventions should be encouraged to mitigate the risk of developing hypertension, and as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the need for medications. Pharmacological therapy with diuretics, renin-angiotensin system blockers, and calcium channel blockers have all shown benefit on cardiovascular outcomes in older patients. Given the economic and public health burden of hypertension in the United States and globally, it is critical to address lifestyle modifications in younger generations to prevent hypertension with age.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drug prescribing to the elderly is extensive and often inappropriate. Furthermore, the number of drugs used is the most important risk factor for adverse drug reactions. Despite this, drug prescribing in the elderly in Sweden is high and increasing. In 2003 the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare launched a set of indicators to evaluate the quality of drug therapy in the elderly. Use of this tool in combination with the Swedish computerized national register covering all persons receiving multi-dose drug dispensing (drugs dispensed in one dose unit bag for each dose occasion) would enable detection of inappropriate drug prescribing and could help reduce the risk of drug-related problems among the elderly. OBJECTIVES: To assess the extent and quality of drug prescribing in younger and older elderly residents receiving multi-dose drug dispensing in ordinary nursing homes (NHs) and special care units for dementia (NHDs), and to evaluate the relationship between the quality of prescribing and the number of prescribers per resident, in a Swedish county. METHODS: The computerized national pharmacy drug register provided the database and a cross-sectional design was used. Selected drug-specific quality indicators proposed by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare in 2003 were used to assess the quality of drug prescribing. RESULTS: This study included 3705 residents. Their mean age was 85 years and 72\% were women. The mean number of prescribed drugs was 10.3 per resident. The proportion of residents with prescriptions for psychotropic drugs was 80\% in NHs and 85\% in NHDs. The prevalence of each drug-specific quality indicator was as follows: long-acting benzodiazepines 16.4\% (NHs) versus 11.7\% (NHDs), anticholinergic drugs 20.7\% versus 18.5\%, drug duplication 14.6\% versus 13.6\%, three or more psychotropic drugs 25.6\% versus 35.3\%, class C interactions (drug combinations that may require dose adjustment) 41.9\% versus 38.7\% and class D interactions (drug combinations that should be avoided) 8.1\% versus 5.6\%. Younger elderly residents (age 65-79 years) had a lower quality of drug prescribing. An increasing number of prescribers per resident was associated with a lower quality of drug therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We found a lower quality of drug prescribing, e.g. anticholinergic drugs prescribed to approximately 20\% of residents of NHs and NHDs, and a higher rate of psychotropic drug use ({$>$}/=80\%) compared with previous studies in NHs. Our results also demonstrated a negative correlation between quality of prescribing and number of prescribers per resident.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Screening tool of older people's prescriptions (STOPP) and screening tool to alert to right treatment (START) criteria were first published in 2008. Due to an expanding therapeutics evidence base, updating of the criteria was required. METHODS: We reviewed the 2008 STOPP/START criteria to add new evidence-based criteria and remove any obsolete criteria. A thorough literature review was performed to reassess the evidence base of the 2008 criteria and the proposed new criteria. Nineteen experts from 13 European countries reviewed a new draft of STOPP \& START criteria including proposed new criteria. These experts were also asked to propose additional criteria they considered important to include in the revised STOPP \& START criteria and to highlight any criteria from the 2008 list they considered less important or lacking an evidence base. The revised list of criteria was then validated using the Delphi consensus methodology. RESULTS: The expert panel agreed a final list of 114 criteria after two Delphi validation rounds, i.e. 80 STOPP criteria and 34 START criteria. This represents an overall 31\% increase in STOPP/START criteria compared with version 1. Several new STOPP categories were created in version 2, namely antiplatelet/anticoagulant drugs, drugs affecting, or affected by, renal function and drugs that increase anticholinergic burden; new START categories include urogenital system drugs, analgesics and vaccines. CONCLUSION: STOPP/START version 2 criteria have been expanded and updated for the purpose of minimizing inappropriate prescribing in older people. These criteria are based on an up-to-date literature review and consensus validation among a European panel of experts.},

There is a diminished thirst, but the relationship of plasma osmolality to arginine vasopressin is at least preserved, and may show increased responsiveness. There is reduced renal function with age and the kidneys' ability to produce a concentrated urine declines. Similarly, the excretion of a water load becomes impaired. Further study is needed of the interaction of specific diseases with these age-associated changes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence, perinatal outcomes and factors associated with neonatal sepsis in referral-level facilities across Nigeria. DESIGN:  Secondary analysis of data from the Maternal and Perinatal Database for Quality,  Equity and Dignity Programme in 54 referral-level hospitals across Nigeria.  SETTING: Records covering the period from 1 September 2019 to 31 August 2020.  POPULATION: Mothers admitted for birth during the study period, and their live  newborns. METHODS: Analysis of prevalence and sociodemographic and clinical  factors associated with neonatal sepsis and perinatal outcomes. Multilevel  logistic regression modelling identified factors associated with neonatal sepsis.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neonatal sepsis and perinatal outcomes. RESULTS: The  prevalence of neonatal sepsis was 16.3 (95\%\,CI 15.3-17.2) per 1000 live births  (1113/68\,459) with a 10.3\% (115/1113) case fatality rate. Limited education,  unemployment or employment in sales/trading/manual jobs, nulliparity/grand  multiparity, chronic medical disorder, lack of antenatal care (ANC) or ANC  outside the birthing hospital and referral for birth increased the odds of  neonatal sepsis. Birthweight of {$<$}2500\,g, non-spontaneous vaginal birth, preterm  birth, prolonged rupture of membranes, APGAR score of {$<$}7 at 5\,min, birth  asphyxia, birth trauma or jaundice were associated with neonatal sepsis. Neonates  with sepsis were more frequently admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit  (1037/1110, 93.4\% vs 8237/67\,346, 12.2\%) and experienced a higher rate of death  (115/1113, 10.3\% vs 933/67\,343, 1.4\%). CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal sepsis remains a  critical challenge in neonatal care, underscored by its high prevalence and  mortality rate. The identification of maternal and neonatal risk factors  underscores the importance of improved access to education and employment for  women and targeted interventions in antenatal and intrapartum care.},

  abstract = {A gender-specific drug utilization study was performed in the Campania region, Southern Italy. Data were based on outpatient drug prescriptions collected from administrative databases. The study population included all patients with at least one drug prescription in 2018. Prevalence was used as a measure to estimate the degree of exposure to drugs. A total of 3,899,360 patients were treated with at least one drug (54.2\% females). The number of prescriptions was higher in females than males (55.6\% vs. 44.4\%). Females recorded higher prevalence for the majority of therapeutic groups (ATC II-anatomical therapeutic chemical), as well as for anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products drugs (M01) (25.6\% vs. 18.7\%, risk ratio (RR): 0.73), beta blocking agents (C07) (14.5\% vs. 11.6\%, RR: 0.80), psychoanaleptics (N06) (7.1\% vs. 3.7\%, RR: 0.52), and antianemic preparations (B03) (2.8\% vs. 6.7\%, RR: 0.4). Higher prevalence was identified for males only for drugs used in diabetes (A10) (6.8\% vs. 6.2\%, RR: 1.1), particularly for biguanides (A10BA). Conversely, treatment duration was longer among males, explaining the higher mean cost per treated patient. This real-world study showed substantial gender differences in terms of medication use and duration of treatment and costs. These results are relevant to promoting and supporting the emerging role of precision and personalized medicine.},

The extent to which individual autonomy operates for each partner within the context of decision-making within marital or similar relationships is largely unexplored. This paper explores issues related to decision-making by couples (couples' joint decision-making) for health care and the circumstances under which such a practice should be respected as compatible with autonomous decision-making.},

DESIGN: Longitudinal birth cohort study. SETTING: National child development study in Great Britain. PARTICIPANTS: 11,042 people born during one week in 1958. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Obesity at age 33 years defined as body mass index {$>$}or=30. RESULTS: Among 7990 cohort members at age 7 years, teachers reported that poor hand control, poor coordination, and clumsiness "certainly applied" more often among those who would be obese adults, producing adjusted odds ratios of 1.57 (95\% confidence interval 1.13 to 2.20; P=0.008) for poor hand control, 2.30 (1.52 to 3.46; P{$<$}0.001) for poor coordination, and 3.91 (2.61 to 5.87; P{$<$}0.001) for clumsiness. Among 6875 participants who had doctor administered assessments with continuous scores at age 11 years, poorer function was associated with later obesity, indicated by adjusted odds ratios (change in risk per unit increase in score) of 0.88 (0.81 to 0.96; P=0.003) for copying designs, 0.84 (0.78 to 0.91; P{$<$}0.001) for marking squares, and 1.14 (1.06 to 1.24; P{$<$}0.001) for picking up matches (a higher score indicates poor function in this test). Further adjustment for contemporaneous body mass index at age 7 or 11 years did not eliminate statistical significance for any of the associations. CONCLUSION: Some aspects of poorer neurological function associated with adult obesity may have their origins in childhood.},

SETTING Primary health care (PHC). PATIENTS 217 women aged 15-35 years attending PHC for dysuria or urgency-frequency. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Frequency of chlamydial infections. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values of EIA and bacteriuria screening tests, respectively. RESULTS The frequency of chlamydial infection was 3.7\%. In spite of a high specificity of the EIA test (0.94 without DFA) the number of false positives exceeded the number of true positives. No single bacteriuria test showed sufficient diagnostic efficiency. CONCLUSIONS Routine chlamydia testing in young women with UTI symptoms is recommended. EIA test on urine is of little use. Assessing diagnosis of UTI symptoms requires insight into the use of several rapid tests and a dialogue with the patient.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The health care system in Japan has undergone major changes, with increasing focus on specialization and continuity of care in its organization and delivery. Reducing the average length of stay is central to this plan. Readmission is often seen as an avoidable consequence of early discharges. And therefore, the readmission rate is used to assess the quality and efficiency of care. In this study, the main subjects in the implementation of readmission rate as an indicator are laid out and the framework for readmission in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients is applied. METHODS: Literature review concerning readmission in AMI patients was conducted to understand the key points of the framework of the readmission. We then used insurance claims data to implement readmission as an indicator. The study sample consisted of 2,332 patients hospitalized due to AMI in Kyoto Prefecture from April 2009 to March 2010. RESULTS: The 30-day readmission rate after AMI discharge was 3.7\% (87/2,332), with the majority of these admissions due to coronary disease (38\%). This rate was extremely low compared to the results reported in other countries, with readmission rates as high as 20\% observed in the US. However, we observed that countries with high readmission rates had correspondingly short lengths of stay (LOS), and countries such as Germany and Japan with low readmission rates had long LOS. CONCLUSIONS: The readmission rate in Japan is low compared with those in other countries although mean LOS is long. The use of readmission rate may have applications in understanding trends in healthcare quality as Japan attempts to reduce LOS durations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, particularly in developing countries. Time to recovery is an indicator  of the severity of sepsis, and risk factors varied significantly according to  study population and settings. Moreover, published literature regarding the time  to recovery of neonatal sepsis is scarce. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to  assess the time to recovery of neonatal sepsis and determinant factors among  neonates admitted in the Public Hospitals of Central Gondar Zone, Northwest  Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based prospective follow-up study design was  conducted among 631 neonates with sepsis. A structured, pre-tested,  interviewer-administered questionnaire was used. The median time to recovery,  life-table, the Kaplan Meier curve, and the log-rank test were computed. Both  bi-variable and multivariable Cox regression models were applied to analyze the  data. RESULTS: Of all septic neonates, 511 successfully recovered. They were  followed for a total of 4,740-neonate day's observation and the median time to  recovery was 7 days (IQR = 5-10 days). After adjusting for covariates,  intrapartum fever (AHR = 0.69, 95\%CI: 0.49, 0.99), induced onset of labor (AHR =  0.68, 95\%CI: 0.49, 0.94), chest indrawing (AHR = 0.67, 95\%CI: 0.46, 0.99), late  onset sepsis (AHR = 0.55, 95\%CI: 0.40, 0.75), non-oral enteral feeding (AHR =  0.38, 95\%CI: 0.29, 0.50), assisted with bag and mask (AHR = 0.72, 95\%CI: 0.56,  0.93), normal birth weight (AHR = 1.42, 95\%CI: 1.03, 1.94), gestational age of  37-42 weeks (AHR = 1.93, 95\%CI: 1.32, 2.84), septic shock (AHR = 0.08, 95\%CI:  0.02, 0.39), infectious complications (AHR = 0.42, 95\%CI: 0.29, 0.61), being in  critical conditions (AHR = 0.68, 95\%CI: 0.52, 0.89), and early recognition of  illness (AHR = 1.83, 95\%CI: 1.27, 2.63) were independently associated with the  time to recovery of neonatal sepsis. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The time to  recovery of this study was moderately acceptable as compared to the previous  studies. The above-mentioned factors could be used for the early identification  of neonates with sepsis at risk for protracted illness and it could guide prompt  referral to higher centers in primary health sectors. This also will provide  prognostic information to clinicians and families as longer recovery time has  economic and social implications in our country.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency and diagnoses associated with 7- and 30-day acute hospital readmissions of patients discharged to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) from an acute hospital. DESIGN: A quality improvement project focusing on 30-day hospital readmissions, using retrospective data derived from the hospital's electronic data repository. SETTING: A 350-bed nonteaching community hospital in southeast Florida. MEASUREMENTS: Data were collected on all discharges of Medicare fee-for-service patients age 75 and older for a 17-month period in 2007 and 2008. The primary source of data was the hospital's electronic data repository. Seven and 30-day hospital readmission rates were calculated for all discharges to SNFs. Index hospital and readmission diagnoses were determined by hospital coders and categorized by the physician coauthors. RESULTS: Among 10,777 discharges of patients age 75 and older, 3254 (30\%) were discharged to an SNF, and of these, 584 (18\%) were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days; 191 (33\%) of these readmissions occurred within 7 days. The index diagnostic categories with the highest readmission rates were genitourinary disorders (30\%) and cardiovascular disorders (25\%). Specific diagnoses associated with the highest readmission rates included congestive heart failure (CHF) (31\%), urinary tract infection (28\%), renal failure (27\%), and pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (23\% each). Infections and cardiovascular disorders were the primary diagnoses for 63\% of the hospital readmissions (36\% and 27\% respectively). The most frequent readmission primary diagnosis was the same as the index admission primary diagnosis in less than half the cases. CONCLUSION: In this community hospital population, close to 1 in 5 discharges to an SNF resulted in a hospital readmission within 30 days. CHF, renal failure, UTI, pneumonia, and COPD were common index hospital and readmission diagnoses. Care paths and guidelines are available for these conditions that should be helpful to SNFs in initiatives designed to improve transitional care and reduce potentially avoidable hospital readmissions, as well as their associated morbidity and cost.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis remains one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality among neonates in developing countries. It can cause severe  morbidities and sequelae, even though patients survive. Prolonged recovery time  of neonatal sepsis leads to hospitalization, increased cost of treatments,  antimicrobial resistance, disseminated intravascular coagulation, respiratory  failure, septic shock, brain lesions, renal failure, and cardiovascular  dysfunction, and eventually death. Thus, this study aimed to identify the  time-to-recovery of neonatal sepsis and its predictors among newborns admitted to  public hospitals in the North Shoa Zone, Central Ethiopia. METHODS: A  retrospective cohort study was conducted among 508 septic neonates admitted to  selected public hospitals in the North Shoa Zone between March 1, 2021, and March  1, 2023. A systematic random sampling method was used to select eligible medical  records. The data were collected through the open data kit (ODK) Collect Android  app and consequently exported to STATA version 17 for analysis. The data were  analyzed using both univariable and multivariable Cox regression models. The  adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) with its corresponding 95\% confidence interval (CI)  was employed. RESULTS: Of all septic neonates, 441 were recovered. The predictors  of time-to-recovery of neonatal sepsis were premature rupture of membrane (PROM)  (AHR\,=\,0.37; 95\% CI: 0.21, 0.63), intrapartum fever (AHR\,=\,0.49; 95\% CI: 0.32,  0.75), chest-indrawing (AHR\,=\,0.50; 95\% CI: 0.36, 0.68), fifth-minute appearance,  pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (Apgar) score less than seven  (AHR\,=\,0.54; 95\% CI: 0.38, 0.77), gestational age between 37 and 42 weeks  (AHR\,=\,1.35; 95\% CI: 1.06, 1.70), septic shock (AHR\,=\,0.52; 95\% CI: 0.31, 0.85).  CONCLUSION: The median time to recovery from neonatal sepsis in this study was  comparable to the previous studies. Premature rupture of membranes, intrapartum  fever, term gestational age, low fifth minute Apgar score, chest indrawing, and  septic shock were the predictors of time-to recovery of neonatal sepsis.  Therefore, birth attendants are advised to closely adhere to the obstetrics  management protocols when providing care for women who have intrapartum fever and  premature rupture of membranes, as this will help to minimize neonatal sepsis and  the subsequent delay in recovery.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of nurse clinician discharge flow coordinators (DFCs) to identify medical patients at risk of unplanned return to the hospital emergency department within 30 days of discharge and whether a higher predicted risk of return was correlated with preventability. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of patients discharged from medical wards at 2 hospital sites of the McGill University Health Center between September 1, 2011, and January 1, 2012. METHODS: Univariate and multivariate analyses of factors including the ability of DFCs to predict 30-day unplanned returns to the hospital. Assessment of the preventability of returns to the hospital was performed by chart review using prespecified criteria. The ability of DFCs to predict returns was compared to the LACE criteria (length of stay, acute admission through the emergency department, comorbidities, and emergency department visits in the past 6 months). RESULTS: We found that 25.0\% (95\% CI, 21.3-28.5) of our patients returned to the emergency department within 30 days. The DFC predictions were found to be significant in both univariate and multivariate analysis. Patient age, sex, and length of stay were not significant predictors in univariate or multivariate analysis; 13.9\% (95\% CI, 8.2-19.6) of returns were preventable and a further 25.8\% (95\% CI, 18.1-33.5) were potentially preventable with added services in the community. There was a trend toward more preventable or potentially preventable returns with higher predicted probability of return. In contrast the LACE criteria did not have a good predictive capacity in our patient population. CONCLUSION: In a large urban center, experienced nurse clinician DFCs were able to predict 30-day emergency department returns with reasonable accuracy. They were also able to identify the returns to the hospital that were most likely to be preventable. Our data suggests that DFCs can be used to target patients identified as having an increased probability of return with interventions that may be able to reduce the burden of return to hospital.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulmonary dysfunction and cardiovascular disease are major causes of impaired health status in later life, and co-development of these diseases has been reported. AIM: To better understand the pathobiology involved in the co-development of these diseases. METHODS: We investigated the impact of pulmonary dysfunction on the development of cardiovascular disease among people aged{$>$}/=50 years in the English longitudinal study of ageing (ELSA). Hazard ratios were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression models, with and without a time-dependent update of exposure and confounders. Pulmonary function was divided into three categories, with the least affected category as the reference. RESULTS: People with pulmonary dysfunction were at higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease than those with normal pulmonary function: the hazard ratio for pulmonary dysfunction versus healthy in the time-dependent crude analysis of model 1, adjusted for age, body mass index, sex, angina pectoris and heart arrhythmia, was 1.49 (95\% confidence interval 1.2-1.9). The effect varied with the precise definition of pulmonary dysfunction and the subtype of the cardiovascular disease, and decreased after correction for some additional confounders but not after correction for inflammatory biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: A history of pulmonary disease increased the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, but inflammation did not seem to alter the effect of pulmonary dysfunction on cardiovascular disease development. This insight may lead to better understanding and treatment of cardiovascular comorbidities in pulmonary disease; it also indicates that the potentially beneficial effect of targeted anti-inflammatory drugs for pulmonary disease, in terms of reducing cardiovascular risk in these patients, may be limited.},

The indirect and direct roles of PHC in HCAI prevention are debated in light of this guiding principle. With respect to the indirect role of PHC, we discuss the issues of hospital-centrism and ambulatory care-sensitive conditions. The article outlines a number of challenges faced by health services related to PHC's direct role in HCAI prevention, highlights seven key components of HCAI prevention programmes within the PHC sphere and provides practical recommendations for HCAI control and prevention.},

  abstract = {Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is emerging as a major public health priority worldwide. It is a chronic condition influenced by lifestyle and behavior. The risk factors for CKD are highly prevalent among the Indian population, and the number of Indians at risk is increasing. Preventive measures focusing on reducing the prevalence of CKD by limiting exposure to risk factors could be cost effective in a country like India. Kidney diseases disproportionally affect disadvantaged populations and reduce the number of productive years of life. Furthermore, the prospect of financial burden discourages many patients from undergoing treatment, thereby leading to preventable morbidity and death. The management of patients with CKD is focused on early detection or prevention, treatment of the underlying cause (if possible) to curb progression and attention to secondary processes that contribute to ongoing nephron loss. Blood pressure control, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system and disease-specific interventions are the cornerstones of therapy. Health literacy and self-management are critical to improving the outcomes of chronic conditions such as chronic kidney disease. Primary Care and Family physicians act as a bridge between the nephrologist specialist and the CKD patients; which will help in improving the quality of life, reduce physical and psychologic limitations and complications associated with CRF, and help patients return to their families, jobs, and social lives.},

  abstract = {Recent evidence indicates that the relationship between age and health care expenditure is not as straightforward as it appears. In fact, micro-level studies find that time to death, rather than ageing, is possibly the main driver of the escalating health care costs in developed countries. Unfortunately, the evidence at the macro level is less clear and often depends on the specification of the empirical model used. We use an aggregate demand framework to assess whether health expenditure is more likely to be driven by ageing per se or proximity to death. Using panel data from 22 OECD countries from the first half of the 1990s, we find population ageing to be negatively correlated with health expenditure once proximity to death is accounted for. This suggests that the effects of ageing on health expenditure growth might be overstated while the effects of the high costs of medical care at the end of life are potentially underestimated. With respect to the latter, our finding highlights the importance of long-term and hospice care management. An expanded long-term care program may not only improve patient welfare, but also reduce costs of care by reducing the duration of hospital care for terminally ill patients. If expensive medical treatment for patients near the end of life can be controlled for, health expenditure growth resulting from population ageing is unlikely to present a most serious problem.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: with ageing populations and increasing exposure to risk factors for chronic diseases, the prevalence of chronic disease multimorbidity is rising globally. There is little evidence on the determinants of multimorbidity and its impact on healthcare utilisation and health status in Europe. METHODS: we used cross-sectional data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) in 2011-12, which included nationally representative samples of persons aged 50 and older from 16 European nations. Negative binomial and logistic regression models were used to assess the association between number of chronic diseases and healthcare utilisation, self-perceived health, depression and reduction of functional capacity. RESULTS: overall, 37.3\% of participants reported multimorbidity; the lowest prevalence was in Switzerland (24.7\%), the highest in Hungary (51.0\%). The likelihood of having multimorbidity increased substantially with age. Number of chronic conditions was associated with greater healthcare utilisation in both primary (regression coefficient for medical doctor visits = 0.29, 95\% CI = 0.27-0.30) and secondary setting (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for having any hospitalisation in the last year = 1.49, 95\% CI = 1.42-1.55) in all countries analysed. Number of chronic diseases was associated with fair/poor health status (AOR 2.13, 95\% CI = 2.03-2.24), being depressed (AOR 1.48, 95\% CI = 1.42-1.54) and reduced functional capacity (AOR 2.12, 95\% CI = 2.02-2.22). CONCLUSION: multimorbidity is associated with greater healthcare utilisation, worse self-reported health status, depression and reduced functional capacity in European countries. European health systems should prioritise improving the management of patients with multimorbidity to improve their health status and increase healthcare efficiency.},

We found that the prevalence of multimorbidity rose from 38.2~percent in 2006?07 to 41.5~percent in 2015. Over the ten-year study period we also found a marginal reduction of the impact of multimorbidity on primary care visits and functional capacity. We did not find a reduction of its impact on hospital admissions and quality of life. Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Spain were the countries that showed the largest reduction in the impact of multimorbidity on health outcomes. Multimorbidity continues to pose challenges for European health care systems, with only marginal improvement on health care use and health outcomes since 2006?07.},

In view of the projected low health literacy in Tanzania, we conducted this cross-sectional survey to assess for CVD risk knowledge and its associated factors among patient escorts. METHODS: A total of 1063 caretakers were consecutively enrolled in this cross-sectional study. An adopted questionnaire consisting of 22 statements assessing various CVD risk behaviors was utilized for assessment of knowledge. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess for factors associated with poor knowledge of CVD risks. RESULTS: The mean age was 40.5\,years and women predominated (55.7\%). Over two-thirds had a body mass index (BMI) {$\geq$}25\,kg/m(2), 18.5\% were alcohol drinkers, 3.2\% were current smokers, and 47\% were physically inactive. The mean score was 78.2 and 80.0\% had good knowledge of CVD risks. About 16.3\% believed CVDs are diseases of affluence, 17.4\% thought CVDs are not preventable, and 56.7\% had a perception that CVDs are curable. Low education (OR 2.6, 95\%CI 1.9-3.7, p\,{$<$}\,0.001), lack of health insurance (OR 1.5, 95\%CI 1.1-2.3, p\,=\,0.03), and negative family history of CVD death (OR 2.2, 95\%CI 1.4-3.5, p\,{$<$}\,0.001), were independently associated with poor CVD knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, despite of a good level of CVD knowledge established in this study, a disparity between individual's knowledge and self-care practices is apparent.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Self-medication with antibiotics (SMA) has been reported among university students in many countries, but little research has been done on this issue in China. The objective of this study was to evaluate knowledge and behaviors of university students and risk factors concerning SMA. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a novel questionnaire-based data collection instrument, an anonymous online survey was conducted with the students of Shantou University (STU), a university comprising 8 schools/colleges in eastern Guangdong, China. Of 1,300 respondents (13.8\% of total eligible participants), 47.8\% had self-treated with antibiotics. Logistic regression analysis identified prior knowledge of antibiotics (PKA), older age, and higher monthly allowance as independent risk factors for SMA. PKA significantly influenced students' knowledge about antibiotics, their uses, and common adverse reactions (all p{$<$}0.05). Among self-medicated students, 61.7\% used antibiotics at least twice in the previous year. Community pharmacies were the major source of self-prescribed antibiotics. Reported common indications for SMA were sore throat (59.7\%), fever (38.2\%), cough (37.4\%), runny nose (29.3\%), and nasal congestion (28.7\%). While 74.1\% of self-medication episodes were based on students' own experiences, only 31.1\% of students claimed to understand the package insert. Alteration of antibiotics and dosage during the course of self-treatment was made by 63.8\% and 55.6\% of students, respectively. At least two kinds of antibiotics were simultaneously taken by 82.6\% of students. The majority of self-medicated students failed to complete the course of antibiotics. Adverse reactions were reported by 16.3\% of students. Amoxicillin was the most common antibiotic used for self-medication. CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of SMA was noted among STU students. Presence of risk factors and risk-associated behaviors/attitudes in the study population calls for focused educational intervention and stricter governmental legislation and regulation of antibiotic use and sale in pharmacies.},

METHODS: In-person interviews with a literacy assessment and chart review were conducted with 330 hypertensive patients from six primary care safety net clinics. Mediational analysis was used to test the role of literacy skills in explaining the relationship between education and hypertension knowledge and control. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses that did not make an adjustment for the other variable, both lower educational attainment and more limited literacy were found to be significant independent predictors of poorer hypertension knowledge and control. When literacy was entered into models that included education only, the association between education and knowledge was fully attenuated and no longer significant (Grades 1-8: beta=-0.30, 95\% CI=-1.44-0.83), while the relationship between education and blood pressure control was only minimally reduced (AOR 2.46, 95\% CI 2.10-2.88). More limited literacy skills also was associated with hypertension control in the final model (AOR 2.68, 95\% CI 1.54-4.70). CONCLUSION: Patient literacy mediated the relationship between education and hypertension knowledge. Literacy was a significant independent predictor of blood pressure control, but only minimally explained the relationship between education and blood pressure. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health literacy is critical to the design of educational tools to improve knowledge acquisition. However, in order to impact health outcome, future health literacy studies should also address other psychosocial factors that impact motivation and capability to manage disease.},

The present study is undertaken to find out prevalence of  neonatal sepsis, recognize bacterial pathogens, neonatal risk factors, major  symptoms, and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern in neonates in tertiary care  hospital in southern Nepal. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was  carried out in a tertiary care hospital from 2nd January 2017 to 20th February  2018 after approval (Ref: 125/2016-17). The sample size was calculated and  convenience sampling was done. Data were collected from hospital records and  microbiology laboratory and analyzed by Statistical Package for Social Sciences.  RESULTS: Out of 1200 clinically suspected cases, early-onset neonatal sepsis was  seen in 290 (79.89\%). A positive culture was seen in 363 (30.25\%) where maximum  bacterial growth was found in 254 (69.98\%) males. Preterm gestational age was  seen in 265 (73\%), low birth weight 284 (78.23\%), a vaginal delivery mode in 279  (76.90\%), and delivery in hospital in 232 (63.91\%). Likewise, Staphylococcus  aureus in 229 (63.08\%) was found maximum followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae in  48(13.22\%). The major symptom observed was Respiratory distress in 245 (20.41\%)  while culture positive was seen in poor cry in 94 (53.10\%). Mainly effective  antibiotics against Gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were Linezolid in  250 (94\%) and Imipenem in 46 (90.19\%), whereas Penicillin-G in 254 (99.21\%) and  Ampicillin in 38 (94.74\%) found resistance towards organisms respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of neonatal sepsis in our study reflects a huge  challenge to reduce the neonatal mortality rate to 12 by 2030 of Sustainable  Development Goals. Bacterial isolates exhibited higher resistance towards  commonly used antibiotics.},

  abstract = {Dementia is a major concern among growing chronic diseases in the aging society and its association with polypharmacy has not been adequately assessed. The objective of this study was to determine the association between polypharmacy and dementia through multiple statistical approaches. We conducted a nested case-control study for newly diagnosed dementia cases using the South Korean National Health Insurance Service sample cohort database (2002--2013, n = 1,025,340). Interactions between polypharmacy (an average use of {$\geq$}5 prescription drugs daily) and comorbidities or potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) were tested. The odds ratios (ORs) for dementia were analyzed according to the presence of comorbidities, PIM uses, the average number of prescribed daily drugs, and significant interactions with polypharmacy using univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. A higher prevalence of comorbidities, history of PIM use, higher PIM exposure, and higher proportion of polypharmacy were noted among cases than in controls. In the univariate analysis, the OR for dementia increased significantly with the increase in the number of prescribed drugs [1--{$<$}5 drugs: 1.72, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.56--1.88; 5--{$<$}10 drugs: 2.64, 95\% CI: 2.32--3.05; {$\geq$}10 drugs: 3.35, 95\% CI: 2.38--4.71; {$<$}1 drug used as reference]. Polypharmacy was correlated with comorbidities and PIM use, and significant interactions were observed between polypharmacy and anticholinergics; H2-receptor antagonists; and comorbidities such as hypertension, peripheral or cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, hemiplegia, diabetes, depression, all other mental disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peptic ulcer disease, and chronic liver disease (p{$<$}0.001). In the multiple regression analysis, most cases exhibited increasing ORs for dementia with increasing polypharmacy levels. Moreover, the increase in OR was more evident in the absence of drugs or comorbidities that showed significant interactions with polypharmacy than in their presence. Polypharmacy increases the risk of PIM administration, and as some PIMs may have cognition-impairing effects, prolonged polypharmacy may result in dementia. Therefore, efforts are needed to limit or decrease the prescription of medications that have been associated with risk of dementia in the elderly.},

We are conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled, 2 {\texttimes} 2  factorial interventional trial in a rural population in Haydom, Tanzania, to  determine the effect of 1) antimicrobials (azithromycin and nitazoxanide) and/or  2) nicotinamide, a niacin vitamer, on attained length at 18 months. Mother/infant  dyads were enrolled within 14 days of the infant's birth from September 2017 to  September 2018, with the follow-up to be completed in February 2020. Here, we  describe the baseline characteristics of the study cohort, risk factors for low  enrollment weight, and neonatal adverse events (AEs). Risk factors for a low  enrollment weight included being a firstborn child (-0.54 difference in  weight-for-age z-score [WAZ] versus other children, 95\% CI: -0.71, -0.37), lower  socioeconomic status (-0.28, 95\% CI: -0.43, -0.12 difference in WAZ), and birth  during the preharvest season (November to March) (-0.22, 95\% CI: -0.33, -0.11  difference in WAZ). The most common neonatal serious AEs were respiratory tract  infections and neonatal sepsis (2.2 and 1.4 events per 100 child-months,  respectively). The study cohort represents a high-risk population for whom  interventions to improve child growth and development are urgently needed.  Further analyses are needed to understand the persistent impacts of seasonal  malnutrition and the interactions between seasonality, socioeconomic status, and  the study interventions.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: During care transitions, the movement of patients from one healthcare practitioner or setting to another, patients are vulnerable to serious lapses in the quality and safety of their medical care. The Care Transitions Intervention (CTI), a 4-week, low-cost, low-intensity self-management program designed to provide patients discharged from the acute care setting with skills, tools, and the support of a transition coach to ensure that their health and self-management needs are met, was implemented in 10 hospital-community-based partnership sites in California over a 12-month period. Five of the partnerships were hospital-led sites, and 5 were county-led sites. The primary goal of the project was to identify factors that promote sustainability of the intervention by (1) assessing features of each site's implementation and the site's likelihood of continuing the program; (2) soliciting feedback from the sites; and (3) analyzing site and patient characteristic data and data from the CTI measurement instruments (the 3-item Care Transition Measure [CTM-3] and the Patient Activation Assessment [PAA] tool). PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING(S): The CTI was implemented in 10 California hospital and community-based organizations that received training and technical support to implement the intervention. FINDINGS: Presence of leadership support was determined to be the critical factor for sites reporting interest in and capacity for long-term support of the CTI. Sites identified engaging hospital- and community-based leaders, providing additional transition coach training, and the assigning of consistent and dedicated (funded) transition coaches as valuable lessons learned. Key findings from the measurement instruments indicate that future CTI implementations should focus on medication management, patients with cardiovascular conditions and diabetes, patients older than 85 years, and African American and Latino patients. Mean PAA scores were moderately higher for patients from hospital-led sites than for patients from county-led sites and moderately higher for patients from sites with full plans for continuation than for patients from sites with partial or minor plans to continue the CTI. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: This implementation of the CTI, with its flexible design responsive to the diverse needs of patients, hospitals, and community organizations, provides a host of real-world lessons on how to improve and sustain effective patient transitions between care settings. Healthcare systems interested in improving care transitions have a compelling reason to explore the viability of implementing the intervention with attention to developing or addressing the following: strong care transitions leadership; collaborative hospital-community partnerships; the particular needs of diverse communities; patient-level medication reconciliation and management; and tailoring the model to the unique needs of patients with cardiovascular conditions and diabetes.},

  abstract = {Background In patients with type 2 diabetes, the effects of intensive glucose control on vascular outcomes remain uncertain. Methods We randomly assigned 11,140 patients with type 2 diabetes to undergo either standard glucose control or intensive glucose control, defined as the use of gliclazide (modified release) plus other drugs as required to achieve a glycated hemoglobin value of 6.5\% or less. Primary end points were composites of major macrovascular events (death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke) and major microvascular events (new or worsening nephropathy or retinopathy), assessed both jointly and separately. Results After a median of 5 years of follow-up, the mean glycated hemoglobin level was lower in the intensive-control group (6.5\%) than in the standard-control group (7.3\%). Intensive control reduced the incidence of combined major macrovascular and microvascular events (18.1\%, vs. 20.0\% with standard control; hazard ratio, 0.90; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 0.98; P = 0.01), as well as that of major microvascular events (9.4\% vs. 10.9\%; hazard ratio, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.77 to 0.97; P = 0.01), primarily because of a reduction in the incidence of nephropathy (4.1\% vs. 5.2\%; hazard ratio, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.66 to 0.93; P = 0.006), with no significant effect on retinopathy (P = 0.50). There were no significant effects of the type of glucose control on major macrovascular events (hazard ratio with intensive control, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.84 to 1.06; P=. 032), death from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio with intensive control, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.74 to 1.04; P = 0.12), or death from any cause (hazard ratio with intensive control, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.83 to 1.06; P = 0.28). Severe hypoglycemia, although uncommon, was more common in the intensive-control group (2.7\%, vs. 1.5\% in the standard-control group; hazard ratio, 1.86; 95\% CI, 1.42 to 2.40; P{$<$}0.001). Conclusions A strategy of intensive glucose control, involving gliclazide (modified release) and other drugs as required, that lowered the glycated hemoglobin value to 6.5\% yielded a 10\% relative reduction in the combined outcome of major macrovascular and microvascular events, primarily as a consequence of a 21\% relative reduction in nephropathy.

METHODS: We searched Medline and Embase from inception to December 2014. Where possible we performed meta-analysis to obtain summary odds ratios (ORs), exploring heterogeneity between studies through sub-group analysis. RESULTS: We identified 24 cross-sectional studies that largely reported on education, deprivation or income in relation to multimorbidity occurrence. Differences in analysis methods allowed pooling of results for education only. Low versus high education level was associated with a 64\% increased odds of multimorbidity (summary OR: 1.64, 95\% CI 1.41 to 1.91), with substantial heterogeneity between studies partly explained by method of multimorbidity ascertainment. Increasing deprivation was consistently associated with increasing risk of multimorbidity, whereas the evidence on income was mixed. Few studies reported on interaction with age or sex. CONCLUSIONS: More methodologically robust studies that address these gaps and investigate alternate measures of social circumstances and environment may advance our understanding of how SEP affects multimorbidity risk. Implications for public health: A deeper understanding of the socioeconomic and demographic patterning of multimorbidity will help identify sub-populations at greatest risk of becoming multimorbid.},

METHODS: Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (1992-2008), a series of hierarchical linear models are used to estimate number of chronic conditions at survey midpoint and the rate of increase in chronic conditions across 18 years of data. RESULTS: Results suggest that lower childhood socioeconomic status (SES) and poor childhood health are associated with increased number of chronic conditions; however, childhood SES is no longer associated with chronic conditions after adjustment for adult SES and adult health. Poor childhood health continues to be associated with total number of chronic conditions after adjustment for adult SES and health. Rate of change in chronic conditions was not associated with childhood conditions. Results from a multinomial logistic regression model further indicated that the association between childhood conditions and adult multimorbidity increased at higher levels of multimorbidity. DISCUSSION: This research adds to the evidence that early life conditions have a lasting influence on adult health, and that their influence may be independent of adult health and SES.},

This study aimed to assess public knowledge, beliefs, and behavior concerning antibiotic use and self-medication in Lithuania. The cross-sectional survey method was processed using a validated questionnaire in different regions of Lithuania. In total, 1005 adults completed the questionnaire and were included in the study. More than half of the respondents (61.1\%) had poor knowledge of antibiotics. Almost half of the respondents incorrectly identified antibiotics as being effective either against viral (26.0\%) or mixed (bacterial and viral) infections (21.7\%). The respondents with lower educational qualifications (OR = 2.515; 95\% CI 1.464-4.319; p = 0.001) and those from rural areas (OR = 1.765; 95\% CI 1.041-2.991; p = 0.035) were significantly less knowledgeable of antibiotics. There was no significant difference between genders, different age groups, or different parenthood status. The determined level of self-medication with antibiotics was 31.0\%.

At baseline, height, weight, and arm muscle circumference were measured. Self-reported weight loss prior to baseline, energy, and protein intake were recorded. Covariates included sociodemographic factors, social network variables, functional and health status. Cox's multivariate survival analysis was used to identify independent predictors of institutionalization. Over the period of observation, 46\% of subjects were institutionalized. Univariate predictors included weight loss ⩾5 kg, functional status, and not living alone. In multivariate analysis, weight loss significantly increased the likelihood of institutionalization [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.71 (95\% CI: 1.08--2.73)] as did limited functional capacities [HR = 1.26 (95\% CI: 1.02--1.55)].

METHODS: we studied 124 patients aged 65 years or over who were readmitted within 28 days of discharge. We determined the views of hospital staff and the patient's general practitioner on the reasons for readmission and compared them using McNemar's test. RESULTS: the crude readmission rate was 13.2\%. The commonest agreed reason for readmission was a relapse or complication of the initial illness. Opinions differed most significantly when the reason was poor health or inadequate preparation on discharge. CONCLUSION: hospital discharge policies should take into account general practitioners' views on the causes of unplanned readmission.},

Frailty in older adults: evidence for a phenotype. J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci. 2001;56:M146-M156.) requires the administration of performance tests (gait speed, handgrip strength) not always feasible in routine clinical practice. Furthermore, the discriminative capacity of the instrument has been rarely investigated. Aim of this study was to evaluate the discriminative capacity of the FP and compare it with a modified version including only anamnestic information. METHODS: Data are from 890 participants of the InCHIANTI study without impairment in activities of daily living (ADL) at baseline (mean age 74 years, women 55\%). Frailty was defined by (a) the presence of {$\geq$}3 criteria of the FP, and (b) having {$\geq$}2 criteria of an anamnestic FP (AFP), not including gait speed and handgrip strength. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were used to evaluate the discriminative capacity of both definitions for incident disability (ie, loss of at least one ADL), incidence of "accelerated" disability (loss of {$>$}2 ADL) over a 6-year follow-up, and 5-years mortality. RESULTS: FP and AFP yielded a frailty prevalence of 6.4\% and 6.5\%, respectively; only 32 patients were considered frail by both indices (kappa: .53). For incident disability, FP showed sensitivity = .194, specificity = .963, PPV = .400, and NPV = .903. Similarly, AFP had sensitivity = .129, specificity = .949, PPV = .245, and NPV = .894. Consistent results were found for accelerated disability and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In our sample, both FP and AFP showed low sensitivity in identifying older people who would die or develop disability, but they could well discriminate people who would not experience adverse outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background/Research Question:In the health literacy (HL) discourse there is debate about the ways by which HL is impacting health. Three different, logically non-exclusive hypotheses are proposed: (a) HL as a specific, direct, social determinant of health; (b) HL as a mediator between other determinants and health; and (c) HL as a moderator of the effect of other determinants on health. Only few examples of empirically testing the mediator or moderator hypothesis exist. The data of the European Health Literacy Survey allow testing of the three hypotheses comparatively in parallel for functional and comprehensive HL.Methods:Data collection was based on multistage random samples of about 1000 European Union citizens aged 15 or older with Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing or Paper Assisted Personal Interviewing methodology in 2011 in eight Member States of the EU. Demographic and socio-economic indicators, a comprehensive (European Health Literacy Survey Q47) and a functional (Newest Vital Sign Test) health literacy measure and one self-assessed health variable were surveyed. Correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis and path analysis were performed.Results:Comprehensive HL (and to a much lesser degree functional HL) is a relevant predictor for self-assessed health. Also, comprehensive HL is only to a limited degree mediating the effects of other determinants on self-assessed health and only for age does HL partly moderate the effect on health. Explained variance and strength of effects vary considerably by national context.Conclusions/Implications:Comprehensive HL is a critical, direct determinant of health. Therefore comprehensive HL has a considerable potential for health promotion to improve population health and tackle the health gap. But comprehensive HL measurement should be standardised in every country to allow for designing adequate measures for the specific situation of the country and also for benchmarking. For better understanding of the causal structure of the impact of HL on health, longitudinal studies will be needed.}

  abstract = {Background: The economic burden of multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) and its socio-economic influencing factors have widely raised public concerns. However, there are few large population-based studies on these problems in China. Our study aims at determining the economic burden of MCCs and associated factors specific to multimorbidity among middle-aged and older individuals. Methods: As our study population, we extracted all 11,304 participants over 35\,years old from the 2018 National Health Service Survey (NHSS) in Yunnan. Economic burden and socio-demographic characteristics were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Chi-square test and generalized estimating equations (GEE) regression models were used to identify influencing factors. Results: The prevalence of chronic diseases was 35.93\% in 11,304 participants and the prevalence of MCCs increased with age, was 10.12\%. Residents who lived in rural areas were more likely to report MCCs than those who lived in urban areas (adjusted OR =\,1.347, 97.5\% CI: 1.116--1.626). Ethnic minority groups were less likely to report MCCs than those of Han (OR=\,0.752, 97.5\% CI: 0.601--0.942). Overweight or obese people were more likely to report MCCs than people with normal weight (OR=\,1.317, 97.5\% CI: 1.099--1.579). The per capita expenses of 2\,weeks' illness, per capita hospitalization expenses, annual household income, annual household expenses, and annual household medical expenses of MCCs were ¥292.90 ({\textpm}1427.80), ¥4804.22 ({\textpm}11851.63), ¥51064.77 ({\textpm}52158.76), ¥41933.50 ({\textpm}39940.02) and ¥11724.94 ({\textpm}11642.74), respectively. The per capita expenses of 2\,weeks' illness, per capita hospitalization expenses, annual household income, annual household cost, and annual household medical expenses of hypertensive co-diabetic patients were more compared to those with other three comorbidity modes. Conclusion: The prevalence of MCCs was relatively high among middle-aged and older individuals in Yunnan, China, which bought a heavy economic burden. This encourages policy makers and health providers to pay more attention to the behavioral/lifestyle factors, that contribute to multimorbidity to a great extent. Furthermore, health promotion and education in terms of MCCs need to be prioritized in Yunnan.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objectives of the study were to estimate the incidence of readmission one month after discharge, to determine the proportion of planned readmissions and of those avoidable, and to identify risk factors associated with early readmissions in elderly admitted to an acute geriatric unit. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on a sample of 322 patients, 75 years of age or older, discharged from an acute geriatric service. A phone follow-up was realized one month after discharge. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify risk factors for readmission. RESULTS: Global incidence of early readmission was 16.2\% (that is 50 rehospitalizations), 18.0\% of which were planned. Among the 21 readmissions to the same service, five were avoidable according to the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol. Logistic regression analysis identified three patient characteristics that were independent predictors of early readmission, which were: a need of help for locomotion (OR=4.38, p=0.002), a negative answer to the question "do you feel that your life is empty?" (OR=2.22, p=0.02) and a short length of stay (p{$<$}0.02). CONCLUSION: A better knowledge of risk factors should allow targeting patients at high risk of early hospital readmission, which should profit by preventive interventions during the first hospitalization. Two domains of possible action were identified in this study: a sufficient length of stay and a better attention to patients with reduced autonomy, especially for those who go back home after discharge.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Neonatal sepsis caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria has a high morbidity and mortality, especially in low- and middle-income countries.  Here, the molecular mechanisms of multidrug resistance in bacteria responsible  for neonatal sepsis were determined. METHODS: From July to December 2019,  documented bacteraemia from 524 neonates hospitalised in a neonatal intensive  care unit in Morocco were collected. Whole-genome sequencing was used to  characterise the resistome; multi-locus sequence typing was used to investigate  phylogeny. RESULTS: Among the 199 cases of documented bacteraemia, 40 (20\%) and  20 (10\%) were caused by MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter hormaechei,  respectively. Of these, 23 (38.5\%) were early neonatal infections ({$\leq$}3 days of  life). Twelve different sequence types (STs) were observed among K. pneumoniae  isolates, the most prevalent being ST1805 (n~=~10) and ST307 (n~=~8). Twenty-one  K. pneumoniae isolates (53\%) possessed the bla(CTX-M-15) gene, six of which  co-produced OXA-48; two, NDM-7; and two, OXA-48 and NDM-7. The bla(OXA-48) gene  was present in 11 K. pneumoniae isolates (27.5\%); bla(NDM-1), in 13 (32.5\%); and  bla(NDM-7), in 4 (10.0\%). Eighteen E. hormaechei isolates (90.0\%) produced an  extended-spectrum {$\beta$}-lactamase (ESBL). Three were SHV-12 producers that  co-produced CMY-4 and NDM-1, and 15 were CTXM-15 producers, of which 6  co-produced OXA-48. Twelve different STs belonging to three different E.  hormaechei subspecies were observed, with one to four isolates. K. pneumoniae and  E. hormaechei isolates belonging to the same ST had less than 20 single  nucleotide polymorphism differences and were found throughout the study period,  highlighting their endemic presence in the neonatal intensive care unit.  CONCLUSION: Thirty percent of neonatal sepsis cases (23 early and 37 late) were  caused by highly drug-resistant carbapenemase- and/or ESBL-producing  Enterobacterales.},

  abstract = {When more than one statistical test is performed in analysing the data from a clinical study, some statisticians and journal editors demand that a more stringent criterion be used for ``statistical significance'' than the conventional P{$<$}0.05.1 Many well meaning researchers, eager for methodological rigour, comply without fully grasping what is at stake. Recently, adjustments for multiple tests (or Bonferroni adjustments) have found their way into introductory texts on medical statistics, which has increased their apparent legitimacy. This paper advances the view, widely held by epidemiologists, that Bonferroni adjustments are, at best, unnecessary and, at worst, deleterious to sound statistical inference. \#\#\#\# Summary points Adjusting statistical significance for the number of tests that have been performed on study data---the Bonferroni method---creates more problems than it solves The Bonferroni method is concerned with the general null hypothesis (that all null hypotheses are true simultaneously), which is rarely of interest or use to researchers The main weakness is that the interpretation of a finding depends on the number of other tests performed The likelihood of type II errors is also increased, so that truly important differences are deemed non-significant Simply describing what tests of significance have been performed, and why, is generally the best way of dealing with multiple comparisons Bonferroni adjustments are based on the following reasoning.1-3 If a null hypothesis is true (for instance, two treatment groups in a randomised trial do not differ in terms of cure rates), a significant difference (P{$<$}0.05) will be observed by chance once in 20 trials. This is the type I error, or {$\alpha$}. When 20 independent tests are performed (for example, study groups are compared with regard to 20 unrelated variables) and the null hypothesis holds for all 20 comparisons, the chance of at least one test being significant is no longer 0.05, but 0.64. {\dots}},

OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between health literacy, patient recall of antihypertensive medications, and reconciliation between patient self-report and the medical record. DESIGN: In-person interviews, literacy assessment, medical records abstraction. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with hypertension at three community health centers. MEASUREMENT: We measured health literacy using the short-form Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. Patients were asked about the medications they took for blood pressure. Their responses were compared with the medical record. RESULTS: Of 119 participants, 37 (31\%) had inadequate health literacy. Patients with inadequate health literacy were less able to name any of their antihypertensive medications compared to those with adequate health literacy (40.5\% vs 68.3\%, p = 0.005). After adjusting for age and income, this difference remained (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.9, 95\% confidence interval [95\%CI] = 1.3-6.7). Agreement between patient reported medications and the medical record was low: 64.9\% of patients with inadequate and 37.8\% with adequate literacy had no medications common to both lists. CONCLUSIONS: Limited health literacy was associated with a greater number of unreconciled medications. Future studies should investigate how this may impact safety and hypertension control.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Complex medication regimens pose self-management challenges, particularly among populations with low levels of health literacy. OBJECTIVE: To test medication management tools delivered through a commercial electronic health record (EHR) with and without a nurse-led education intervention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 3-group cluster randomized clinical trial was performed in community health centers in Chicago, Illinois. Participants included 794 patients with hypertension who self-reported using 3 or more medications concurrently (for any purpose). Data were collected from April 30, 2012, through February 29, 2016, and analyzed by intention to treat. INTERVENTIONS: Clinics were randomly assigned to to groups: electronic health record-based medication management tools (medication review sheets at visit check-in, lay medication information sheets printed after visits; EHR-alone group), EHR-based tools plus nurse-led medication management support (EHR plus education group), or usual care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes at 12 months included systolic blood pressure (primary outcome), medication reconciliation, knowledge of drug indications, understanding of medication instructions and dosing, and self-reported medication adherence. Medication outcomes were assessed for all hypertension prescriptions, all prescriptions to treat chronic disease, and all medications. RESULTS: Among the 794 participants (68.6\% women; mean [SD] age, 52.7 [9.6] years), systolic blood pressure at 12 months was greater in the EHR-alone group compared with the usual care group by 3.6 mm Hg (95\% CI, 0.3 to 6.9 mm Hg). Systolic blood pressure in the EHR plus education group was not significantly lower compared with the usual care group (difference, -2.0 mm Hg; 95\% CI, -5.2 to 1.3 mm Hg) but was lower compared with the EHR-alone group (-5.6 mm Hg; 95\% CI, -8.8 to -2.4 mm Hg). At 12 months, hypertension medication reconciliation was improved in the EHR-alone group (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 2.9) and the EHR plus education group (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.3 to 3.3) compared with usual care. Understanding of medication instructions and dosing was greater in the EHR plus education group than the usual care group for hypertension medications (OR, 2.3; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 4.8) and all medications combined (OR, 1.7; 95\% CI, 1.0 to 2.8). Compared with usual care, the EHR tools alone and EHR plus education interventions did not improve hypertension medication adherence (OR, 0.9; 95\% CI, 0.6-1.4 for both) or knowledge of chronic drug indications (OR for EHR tools alone, 1.0 [95\% CI, 0.6 to 1.5] and OR for EHR plus education, 1.1 [95\% CI, 0.7-1.7]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The study found that EHR tools in isolation improved medication reconciliation but worsened blood pressure. Combining these tools with nurse-led support suggested improved understanding of medication instructions and dosing but did not lower blood pressure compared with usual care.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Examine associations between health literacy and several medication self-management constructs among a population of adults with uncontrolled hypertension. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study of health center patients from the Chicago area with uncontrolled hypertension enrolled between April 2012 and February 2015. Medication self-management constructs-applied to hypertension medications, chronic condition medications and all medications-included: 1) medication reconciliation, 2) knowledge of drug indications, 3) understanding instructions and dosing, and 4) self-reported adherence over 4 days (no missed doses). We determined associations between health literacy and self-management outcomes using multivariable generalized linear regression. RESULTS: There were 1460 patients who completed screening interviews; 62.9\% enrolled and had complete baseline data collected, and were included in the analysis. Of 919 participants, 47.4\% had likely limited (low), 33.2\% possibly limited, and 19.4\% likely adequate health literacy. Compared to participants with likely adequate health literacy, participants with low health literacy were less likely to have chronic medications reconciled (18.0\% versus 29.6\%, p=0.007), know indications for chronic medications (64.1\% versus 83.1\%, p{$<$}0.001), and demonstrate understanding of instructions and dosing (68.1\% versus 82.9\%, p=0.001). Self-reported adherence to hypertension medications was higher among the low health literacy group (65.6\% versus 56.0\%, p=0.010). In multivariable models, health literacy was strongly associated with knowledge of drug indications, and understanding of instructions and dosing. CONCLUSION: Low health literacy was associated with worse medication self-management in several domains. However, non-adherence was greatest in the most health literate in unadjusted analysis. Among a population of patients with uncontrolled hypertension, the drivers of poor control may vary by health literacy.},

  abstract = {The field of aging and dementia is focusing on the characterization of the earliest stages of cognitive impairment. Recent research has identified a transitional state between the cognitive changes of normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Mild cognitive impairment refers to the clinical condition between normal aging and AD in which persons experience memory loss to a greater extent than one would expect for age, yet they do not meet currently accepted criteria for clinically probable AD. When these persons are observed longitudinally, they progress to clinically probable AD at a considerably accelerated rate compared with healthy age-matched individuals. Consequently, this condition has been recognized as suitable for possible therapeutic intervention, and several multicenter international treatment trials are under way. Because this is a topic of intense interest, a group of experts on aging and MCI from around the world in the fields of neurology, psychiatry, geriatrics, neuropsychology, neuroimaging, neuropathology, clinical trials, and ethics was convened to summarize the current state of the field of MCI. Participants reviewed the world scientific literature on aging and MCI and summarized the various topics with respect to available evidence on MCI. Diagnostic criteria and clinical outcomes of these subjects are available in the literature. Mild cognitive impairment is believed to be a high-risk condition for the development of clinically probable AD. Heterogeneity in the use of the term was recognized, and subclassifications were suggested. While no treatments are recommended for MCI currently, clinical trials regarding potential therapies are under way. Recommendations concerning ethical issues in the diagnosis and the management of subjects with MCI were made.},

  abstract = {Sibling comparison designs have long been used to assess causal effects of exposures for which randomized studies are impossible and measurement of all relevant confounding is unobtainable. The idea is to utilize the fact that siblings often share a lot of unobserved variables. Therefore, it is proposed that in certain cases, comparing siblings is equivalent to comparing exchangeable individuals, which is the foundation for causal inference based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, this intuition-and the publication of highly important sibling studies-vastly predate modern causal inference theory. Full causal descriptions of sibling comparison designs are essentially nonexistent, and therefore it is not clear exactly how or if we can interpret their estimated effects as causal. We fill this theoretical gap by proposing a counterfactual-based framework for sibling comparison designs. Moreover, we employ this framework to derive precise causal interpretations for three commonly used sibling model estimators stemming from fixed-effects ordinary least squares (OLS), conditional logistic regression, and stratified Cox regression. We establish that, for the latter two, the obtained effect parameter describes a causal effect on the full sibling group, not the individuals, and thus it does not correspond to the prevailing intuition from the RCT analogue. For fixed-effects OLS estimation, the parameter describes a causal effect on an individual, but may depend on an intervention on the whole sibling group. OLS estimation thus results in an estimator that can be given a simple causal interpretation that is similar, but not equal to, the RCT parallel.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between low health literacy and all-cause mortality and hospitalization among outpatients with heart failure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective cohort study conducted at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, an integrated managed care organization. Outpatients with heart failure were identified between January 2001 and May 2008, were surveyed by mail, and underwent follow-up for a median of 1.2 years. Health literacy was assessed using 3 established screening questions and categorized as adequate or low. Responders were excluded if they did not complete at least 1 health literacy question or if they did not have at least 1 year of enrollment prior to the survey date. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalization. RESULTS: Of the 2156 patients surveyed, 1547 responded (72\% response rate). Of 1494 included responders, 262 (17.5\%) had low health literacy. Patients with low health literacy were older, of lower socioeconomic status, less likely to have at least a high school education, and had higher rates of coexisting illnesses. In multivariable Cox regression, low health literacy was independently associated with higher mortality (unadjusted rate, 17.6\% vs 6.3\%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.97 [95\% confidence interval, 1.3-2.97]; P = .001) but not hospitalization (unadjusted rate, 30.5\% vs 23.2\%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.05 [95\% confidence interval, 0.8-1.37]; P = .73). CONCLUSION: Among patients with heart failure in an integrated managed care organization, low health literacy was significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality.},

  abstract = {Improving the healthcare of Americans with multiple chronic conditions is one of the top aims of the U.S. national healthcare research agenda. One of the driving forces behind this objective is the disproportionately high concentration of healthcare expenditures that are attributed to this population. The 2009 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) found that the sickest 10 percent of patients account for 65 percent of all health expenses for the U.S. population (from July 2012 meeting of the National Advisory Council for Healthcare Research and Quality, which focused on trends in healthcare costs and the concentration of medical expenditures).1 Further, the MEPS identified a number of chronic conditions that most influence high levels of expenditures, including heart disease, cancer, mental disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diabetes. Potentially preventable readmissions are among the disproportionately high concentration of healthcare expenditures attributed to the sickest 10 percent of patients. In their June 2007 report to Congress, the MedPAC (Medical Payment Advisory Commission) estimated that 75 percent of Medicare readmissions are potentially preventable.2 Potentially preventable hospitalizations have been linked to discontinuity of primary care.3 In a 1984 randomized trial, elderly male Veterans who saw a different physician at each visit had a statistically significantly higher rate of emergent hospital admissions and longer average length of stays than those who saw the same primary care doctor at every visit.3 Since the 1980's, the problem of high-risk patients with frequent hospital admissions has persisted despite dramatic changes in the practice environment. One important change is the redesign of primary care. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Primary Care Program Office is implementing a Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) model at all primary care sites, in which continuous care is delivered by interdisciplinary teams who serve as the first point of contact for a broad range of fully-integrated health services and community resources. The VA's PACT model and other Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) models are based on earlier innovations such as the Chronic Care Model, the Idealized Design of Clinical Office Practices, and Clinical Microsystems. They seek to implement primary care that is continuous, comprehensive, efficient, patient-driven and team-based.4,5 The PCMH models are not primarily aimed at patients who are at high risk of hospital admission, although most include reducing hospitalizations and emergency room use among their secondary aims. In the VA PACT, for example, hospital care and specialized services are provided outside of the PACT, while coordinators focus on smoothing hand-offs between care settings including those involving VA and non-VA providers. A recent Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) systematic review of 19 comparative studies found that implementation of these models had no effect on hospital admissions (RR 0.96; 95\% CI 0.84-1.10), but it reduced emergency room visits (0.81, 0.67-0.98) and modestly improved staff and patient experiences.6 Disease management and care coordination programs have also sought to improve the quality and delivery of care to patients with high-cost chronic illnesses. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued a brief report (January 2012) on the effects of 34 Medicare demonstration projects on disease management and care coordination programs, and cited the following approaches as helpful in reducing hospital admissions: (1) use of team-based care, especially those with larger teams that include pharmacists; and (2) the smoothing of transitions between a primary care provider and a specialist.7 However, a recent AHRQ review of nurse-led case management programs for adults with medical illnesses and complex care needs found no effect on rates of hospitalization and a variable effect on emergency room use.8 The nurse-led interventions encompassed patient self-management education, health status monitoring, and coordination of care, typified by the Medicare Coordinated Care Demonstration (MCCD). From the viewpoint of caring for frequently hospitalized patients, the rise of hospitalism also poses a challenge to continuity of care. David Meltzer, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Medicine and Director of the Hospitalist Program at the University of Chicago Medicine, has studied the changing medical workforce in the United States and found that the trend toward increased medical specialization has had the unintended consequence of increased fragmentation of primary care.9 One of the key challenges for the primary care system in meeting the complex needs of high-risk patients with multiple chronic conditions is adapting to the increased demands of collaborating with a larger number of associated healthcare providers within a decentralized, fee-for-service healthcare delivery system which does not pay for or facilitate communication or coordination among providers.7 Some would say that we have reached a point where we have to decide if we should continue to invest in programs with an increased need for coordination or in different models that reduce the need for coordination in the first place. Applying team theory literature,10 Dr. Meltzer has said "if you're spending all of your time coordinating, you should change the product."11 For example, Dr. Meltzer has proposed a 'comprehensive care physician model,' to reduce the need for coordination between the primary care and hospitalist settings. In this model, a physician with expertise in both inpatient medicine and primary care leads an interdisciplinary team that carries a panel of approximately 200 frequently hospitalized patients, who they will treat both inside and outside of the hospital.11 The Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services (CMS) have funded a demonstration of this program at the University of Chicago. Others focus on reducing the need for coordination and handoffs between primary care and specialty care. From this viewpoint, admissions from primary care could be reduced through accelerated consults or direct access to intense short stay and complex diagnostic unit services. The persistence of high inpatient utilizers despite the spread of case management and PCMH models has led to interest in 'intensive primary care' models. For example, a new round of CMS-funded demonstration projects focus on intensive models for patients at high risk of using inpatient resources.12 In their Research Brief published by the National Institute for Health Care Reform, Yee et al. proposed a taxonomy for categorizing 'High-Intensity Primary Care' programs, also sometimes called 'Ambulatory Intensive Care Units,' which use PCMH-based approaches to managing the sickest, highest-cost patients.13 In a 'freestanding' model, ongoing care is fully transferred from patients' regular primary care physicians to a dedicated clinic that exclusively or chiefly provides high-intensity primary care to a select group of patients. In contrast, in a 'practice-based' model, patients continue to receive care from their regular primary care physician, but are offered additional, high-intensity services, often managed by a care coordinator. In a hybrid model, care is temporarily shifted from the patients' regular primary care physicians to a dedicated clinic, and returned once their conditions stabilize. These approaches, which involve physician-led, team-based discussion and coordination that serve as the source of primary care, were excluded from the two AHRQ reviews mentioned earlier. As part of the PACT model initiative, the Health Delivery Committee is proposing to develop a primary care intensivist model that deploys well-trained interdisciplinary teams that identify and proactively manage Veterans at highest risk for hospital admission and death. The goal of the model is to reduce emergency department and urgent care utilization, hospitalizations and mortality among complex, high-risk patients. For healthcare system decision-makers, evidence is only one of many different factors taken into account. If a health system waits until there is traditional hard and fast evidence on the effectiveness of a new healthcare model, they would always be 10 years out of date. However, decision-makers do need to consider the findings of the best available research and the strength and applicability of that evidence. This report was produced in response to the Health Delivery Committee's request for an evidence brief to assist with their evaluation of the effectiveness of existing intensive primary care programs involving multimodal interventions delivered by interdisciplinary teams. An evidence brief differs from a full systematic review in that the scope of work is more narrowly defined and the traditional review methods are streamlined in order to synthesize evidence within a shortened timeframe. An evidence brief cannot capture the actual day-to-day program operations of evolving programs. While decision-makers can benefit from knowing about the best available research and the strength and applicability of that evidence, an evidence brief cannot encompass the full range of policy options or novel programs, many of which have not been evaluated in formal studies.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Comprehensive discharge planning plus postdischarge support may reduce readmission rates for older patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of comprehensive discharge planning plus postdischarge support on the rate of readmission in patients with CHF, all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), quality of life (QOL), and medical costs. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE (1966 to October 2003), the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register (all years), Social Science Citation Index (1992 to October 2003), and other databases for studies that described such an intervention and evaluated its effect in patients with CHF. Where possible we also contacted lead investigators and experts in the field. STUDY SELECTION: We selected English-language publications of randomized clinical trials that described interventions to modify hospital discharge for older patients with CHF (mean age {$>$} or =55 years), delineated clearly defined inpatient and outpatient components, compared efficacy with usual care, and reported readmission as the primary outcome. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently reviewed each report, assigned quality scores, and extracted data for primary and secondary outcomes in an unblinded standardized manner. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eighteen studies representing data from 8 countries randomized 3304 older inpatients with CHF to comprehensive discharge planning plus postdischarge support or usual care. During a pooled mean observation period of 8 months (range, 3-12 months), fewer intervention patients were readmitted compared with controls (555/1590 vs 741/1714, number needed to treat = 12; relative risk [RR], 0.75; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.88). Analysis of studies reporting secondary outcomes found a trend toward lower all-cause mortality for patients assigned to an intervention compared with usual care (RR, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.73-1.03; n = 14 studies), similar initial LOS (mean [SE]: 8.4 [2.5] vs 8.5 [2.2] days, P =.60; n = 10), greater percentage improvement in QOL scores compared with baseline scores (25.7\% [95\% CI, 11.0\%-40.4\%] vs 13.5\% [95\% CI, 5.1\%-22.0\%]; n = 6, P =.01), and similar or lower charges for medical care per patient per month for the initial hospital stay, administering the intervention, outpatient care, and readmission (-359 dollars [95\% CI, -763 dollars to 45 dollars]; n = 4, P =.10 for non-US trials and -536 dollars [95\% CI, -956 dollars to -115 dollars]; n = 4, P =.03, for US trials). CONCLUSION: Comprehensive discharge planning plus postdischarge support for older patients with CHF significantly reduced readmission rates and may improve health outcomes such as survival and QOL without increasing costs.},

  abstract = {Pharmacokinetic studies conducted in patients with CRF demonstrate that the nonrenal clearance of multiple drugs is reduced. Although the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear, several studies have shown that CRF affects the metabolism of drugs by inhibiting key enzymatic systems in the liver, intestine and kidney. The down-regulation of selected isoforms of the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP450) has been reported secondary to a decrease in gene expression. This is associated with major reductions in metabolism of drugs mediated by CYP450. The main hypothesis to explain the decrease in liver CYP450 activity in CRF appears to be the accumulation of circulating factors which can modulate CYP450 activity. Liver phase II metabolic reactions are also reduced in CRF. On the other hand, intestinal drug disposition is affected in CRF. Increased bioavailability of several drugs has been reported in CRF, reflecting decrease in either intestinal first-pass metabolism or extrusion of drugs (mediated by P-glycoprotein). Indeed, intestinal CYP450 is also down-regulated secondary to reduced gene expression, whereas, decreased intestinal P-glycoprotein activity has been described. Finally, although the kidneys play a major role in the excretion of drugs, it has the capacity to metabolize endogenous and exogenous compounds. CRF will lead to a decrease in the ability of the kidney to metabolize drugs, but the repercussions on the systemic clearance of drugs is still poorly defined, except for selected xenobiotics. In conclusion, reduced drug metabolism should be taken into account when evaluating the pharmacokinetics of drugs in patients with CRF.},

Multilevel or contextual analyses of social factors and health represent a possible reconciliation between two divergent epidemiological paradigms-individual risk factor epidemiology and an ecological approach. DATA SOURCES: Keyword searching of Index Medicus (Medline) and additional references from retrieved articles. STUDY SELECTION: All original studies of the effect of local area social characteristics on individual health outcomes, adjusted for individual socioeconomic status, published in English before 1 June 1998 and focused on populations in developed countries. DATA SYNTHESIS: The methodological challenges posed by the design and interpretation of multilevel studies of local area effects are discussed and results summarised with reference to type of health outcome. All but two of the 25 reviewed studies reported a statistically significant association between at least one measure of social environment and a health outcome (contextual effect), after adjusting for individual level socioeconomic status (compositional effect). Contextual effects were generally modest and much smaller than compositional effects. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for modest neighbourhood effects on health is fairly consistent despite heterogeneity of study designs, substitution of local area measures for neighbourhood measures and probable measurement error. By drawing public health attention to the health risks associated with the social structure and ecology of neighbourhoods, innovative approaches to community level interventions may ensue.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare blood pressure measurements taken at home by physicians, nurses, and patients with office blood pressure measurement , ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and home blood pressure measurement. METHODS A total of 44 patients seen by a home care program were studied. Protocol 1 a) blood pressure was measured by the patient, a physician and a nurse during a regular home visit (Home1); b) home blood pressure measurement was measured for 4 days (HBPM1); c) office blood pressure measurement was measured by a physician, a nurse, and the patient; and by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Protocol 2 blood pressure was measured by the patient, a physician, and a nurse during a special home visit in the presence of a physician and a nurse only (Home2); and b) home blood pressure measurement was taken for the second time (HBPM2). Echocardiography, guided by a two-dimensional echocardiograph, was performed. RESULTS Protocol 1: a) office blood pressure measurement and Home1 were significantly higher than ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, except for systolic and diastolic office blood pressure measurement taken by the patient or a family member, systolic blood pressure taken by a nurse, and diastolic blood pressure taken by a physician. b) ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and HBPM1 were similar. Protocol 2: a) HBPM2 and Home2 were similar. b) Home2 was significantly lower than Home1, except for diastolic blood pressure taken by a nurse or the patient. There were significant relationships between: a) diastolic blood pressure measured by the patient and the thickness of the interventricular septum, posterior wall, and left ventricular mass; and b) ambulatory and HBPM2 diastolic and systolic blood pressure taken by a physician (home2) and left ventricular mass. Therefore, the data indicate that home blood pressure measurement and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring had good prognostic values relative to ``office measurement.'' CONCLUSION This study showed that the measurement most similar to home blood pressure measurement and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was blood pressure measured by the patient, and that home blood pressure measurement and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring had good prognostic value relative to ``office measurements''.},

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Longitudinal information was collected from a nationally representative sample of Finnish twin adolescents (birth cohorts 1975 to 1979) and their parents through questionnaires mailed when the twins were ages 16 and 18.5 years old. The sample included 702 monozygotic, 724 same-sex dizygotic, and 762 opposite-sex dizygotic sets of twins. The measures used were length, weight, ponderal index (kilograms per cubic meters), and gestational age at birth, and height, weight, and body mass index (kilograms per square meters) at 16 to 18.5 years of age. The changes in genetic and environmental influences on body size from birth to early adulthood were analyzed by quantitative genetic modeling. RESULTS: The twins who had a higher weight or ponderal index at birth were taller and heavier in early adulthood, whereas those who were longer at birth were taller, but not heavier, later in life. Adult height was affected more by the birth size than body mass index. In the genetic modeling analyses, the genetic factors accounting for the variation of body size became more apparent with age, and both genetic and environmental influences on stature had a sizable carry-over effect from birth to late adolescence, whereas for relative weight, the influences were more age-specific. DISCUSSION: The genetic and environmental architecture of body size changes from birth to adulthood. Even in monozygotic twins who share their genetic background, the initially larger twin tended to remain larger, demonstrating the long-lasting effects of fetal environment on final body size.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a global threat to healthcare resulting in an increase in morbidity and mortality. Neonatal sepsis  is ranked as the third highest cause of neonatal demise globally, in which AMR  accounted for 31.0\% of deaths. AMR in neonates has been poorly characterised in  Durban, South Africa. Thus, the resultant effect of AMR on empiric regimens for  neonatal sepsis is uncertain in this setting. Therefore, this study analysed the  aetiology and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bloodstream infections  within the neonatal intensive care unit at a tertiary hospital in Durban, with  the aim of establishing an effective empiric regimen for the unit. METHODS: A  retrospective data review on positive blood cultures from the neonatal intensive  care unit at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital was conducted. Three time  periods were analysed: 2014, 2016 and 2018. Culture data from neonates aged  0-30\,days were included and repeat cultures were de-duplicated. The frequency of  common organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibilities were analysed.  Fischer's exact test was used for subgroup analysis. Poisson and logistic  regressions were used to assess significant trends in organisms and antimicrobial  susceptibilities over time. RESULTS: Late-onset sepsis (86.8\%) predominated over  early-onset sepsis (13.2\%). A preponderance of gram-positive organisms (68.7\%)  over gram-negatives (26.8\%) and fungi (4.5\%) was detected. Common pathogens  included coagulase-negative staphylococci (53.5\%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.6\%),  enterococci (9.3\%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (7.7\%). Despite the small  contribution of fungi to the microbial profile, fluconazole-resistant Candida  parapsilosis predominated within that group. High rates of resistance to first-  and second-line antibiotics were also noted among gram-positive and gram-negative  organisms. Multidrug resistant organisms included extended-spectrum  beta-lactamase (ESBL) K. pneumoniae (7.6\%) and extensively-drug resistant A.  baumannii (7.0\%). However, a statistically significant decrease in ESBL-producing  organisms was documented during the entire study period (p\,=\,0.005). CONCLUSIONS:  It was determined that first-line antimicrobials, advocated by the World Health  Organization for treatment of neonatal sepsis, proved ineffective in this unit  due to high levels of AMR. Therefore, this study advises that meropenem with or  without vancomycin provides optimal empiric cover. Amphotericin B is advocated  for empiric antifungal therapy. Ongoing surveillance is necessary.},

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of intense and long-term exercise on the physical functioning and mobility of home-dwelling patients with AD and to explore its effects on the use and costs of health and social services. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 210 home-dwelling patients with AD living with their spousal caregiver. INTERVENTIONS: The 3 trial arms included (1) group-based exercise (GE; 4-hour sessions with approximately 1-hour training) and (2) tailored home-based exercise (HE; 1-hour training), both twice a week for 1 year, and (3) a control group (CG) receiving the usual community care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Functional Independence Measure (FIM), the Short Physical Performance Battery, and information on the use and costs of social and health care services. RESULTS: All groups deteriorated in functioning during the year after randomization, but deterioration was significantly faster in the CG than in the HE or GE group at 6 (P = .003) and 12 (P = .015) months. The FIM changes at 12 months were -7.1 (95\% CI, -3.7 to -10.5), -10.3 (95\% CI, -6.7 to -13.9), and -14.4 (95\% CI, -10.9 to -18.0) in the HE group, GE group, and CG, respectively. The HE and GE groups had significantly fewer falls than the CG during the follow-up year. The total costs of health and social services for the HE patient-caregiver dyads (in US dollars per dyad per year) were \$25,112 (95\% CI, \$17,642 to \$32,581) (P = .13 for comparison with the CG), \$22,066 in the GE group (\$15,931 to \$28,199; P = .03 vs CG), and \$34,121 (\$24,559 to \$43,681) in the CG. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: An intensive and long-term exercise program had beneficial effects on the physical functioning of patients with AD without increasing the total costs of health and social services or causing any significant adverse effects.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hand hygiene prevents cross infection in hospitals, but compliance with recommended instructions is commonly poor. We attempted to promote hand hygiene by implementing a hospital-wide programme, with special emphasis on bedside, alcohol-based hand disinfection. We measured nosocomial infections in parallel. METHODS: We monitored the overall compliance with hand hygiene during routine patient care in a teaching hospital in Geneva, Switzerland, before and during implementation of a hand-hygiene campaign. Seven hospital-wide observational surveys were done twice yearly from December, 1994, to December, 1997. Secondary outcome measures were nosocomial infection rates, attack rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and consumption of handrub disinfectant. FINDINGS: We observed more than 20,000 opportunities for hand hygiene. Compliance improved progressively from 48\% in 1994, to 66\% in 1997 (p{$<$}0.001). Although recourse to handwashing with soap and water remained stable, frequency of hand disinfection substantially increased during the study period (p{$<$}0.001). This result was unchanged after adjustment for known risk factors of poor adherence. Hand hygiene improved significantly among nurses and nursing assistants, but remained poor among doctors. During the same period, overall nosocomial infection decreased (prevalence of 16.9\% in 1994 to 9.9\% in 1998; p=0.04), MRSA transmission rates decreased (2.16 to 0.93 episodes per 10,000 patient-days; p{$<$}0.001), and the consumption of alcohol-based handrub solution increased from 3.5 to 15.4 L per 1000 patient-days between 1993 and 1998 (p{$<$}0.001). INTERPRETATION: The campaign produced a sustained improvement in compliance with hand hygiene, coinciding with a reduction of nosocomial infections and MRSA transmission. The promotion of bedside, antiseptic handrubs largely contributed to the increase in compliance.},

Although some interventions to improve compliance have been successful, none had achieved lasting improvement until very recently. Reasons for non-compliance with recommendations occur at individual, group and institutional levels. The complexity of the process of behavioural change would suggest that the application of multimodal, multidisciplinary strategies are necessary. Both easy access to hand hygiene in a timely fashion and skin protection appear necessary prerequisites for satisfactory hand hygiene behaviour. Alcohol-based hand-rub may be superior to traditional handwashing as it requires less time, acts faster, irritates hands less often, and recently proved significantly to contribute to sustained improvement in compliance associated with decreased infection rates. This paper reviews barriers to appropriate hand hygiene and describes the results of the first successful experience of sustained hand hygiene promotion and its effectiveness on hospital-acquired infection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physician adherence to hand hygiene remains low in most hospitals. OBJECTIVES: To identify risk factors for nonadherence and assess beliefs and perceptions associated with hand hygiene among physicians. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of physician practices, beliefs, and attitudes toward hand hygiene. SETTING: Large university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 163 physicians. MEASUREMENTS: Individual observation of physician hand hygiene practices during routine patient care with documentation of relevant risk factors; self-report questionnaire to measure beliefs and perceptions. Logistic regression identified variables independently associated with adherence. RESULTS: Adherence averaged 57\% and varied markedly across medical specialties. In multivariate analysis, adherence was associated with the awareness of being observed, the belief of being a role model for other colleagues, a positive attitude toward hand hygiene after patient contact, and easy access to hand-rub solution. Conversely, high workload, activities associated with a high risk for cross-transmission, and certain technical medical specialties (surgery, anesthesiology, emergency medicine, and intensive care medicine) were risk factors for nonadherence. LIMITATIONS: Direct observation of physicians may have influenced both adherence to hand hygiene and responses to the self-report questionnaire. Generalizability of study results requires additional testing in other health care settings and physician populations. CONCLUSION: Physician adherence to hand hygiene is associated with work and system constraints, as well as knowledge and cognitive factors. At the individual level, strengthening a positive attitude toward hand hygiene and reinforcing the conviction that each individual can influence the group behavior may improve adherence among physicians. Physicians who work in technical specialties should also be targeted for improvement.},

The World Health Organization acknowledges neonatal sepsis as a major  global health concern, and that the highest burden occurs in low- and  middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite major research and clinical progress in  this area, we still lack accurate diagnostic tools for neonatal sepsis,  complicating the management of this condition.Areas covered: The purpose here is  to review the latest data on the incidence, diagnosis, prevention, and management  of neonatal sepsis in LMIC. We discuss the limitations of current diagnostic  tests - including their lack of availability - and how this may influence global  estimates of cases. We review the benefits of antenatal, intrapartum, and  post-natal preventive measures. We briefly discuss the management, highlighting  the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Finally, we expose some high priority  areas.Expert opinion: Neonatal sepsis is a challenging condition requiring a  multifaceted approach to address the major diagnostic issues, but also the  underlying socio-economic causes that nourish epidemic cases in LMIC. Focusing on  antibiotics as a main pillar of intervention is likely to engender antimicrobial  resistance, eventually hindering the appreciable gains LMICs have achieved in  neonatal health outcomes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: Previous work has shown that daily skin cleansing with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) is effective in preventing infection in the medical intensive care unit (MICU). A colorimetric, semiquantitative indicator was used to measure CHG concentration on skin (neck, antecubital fossae, and inguinal areas) of patients bathed daily with CHG during their MICU stay and after discharge from the MICU, when CHG bathing stopped. PATIENTS AND SETTING: MICU patients at Rush University Medical Center. METHODS: CHG concentration on skin was measured and skin sites were cultured quantitatively. The relationship between CHG concentration and microbial density on skin was explored in a mixed-effects model using gram-positive colony-forming unit (CFU) counts. RESULTS: For 20 MICU patients studied (240 measurements), the lowest CHG concentrations (0-18.75 mug/mL) and the highest gram-positive CFU counts were on the neck (median, 1.07 log(10) CFUs; [Formula: see text]). CHG concentration increased postbath and decreased over 24 hours ([Formula: see text]). In parallel, median log(10) CFUs decreased pre- to postbath (0.78 to 0) and then increased over 24 hours to the baseline of 0.78 ([Formula: see text]). A CHG concentration above 18.75 mug/mL was associated with decreased gram-positive CFUs ([Formula: see text]). In all but 2 instances, CHG was detected on patient skin during the entire interbath (approximately 24-hour) period (18 [90\%] of 20 patients). In 11 patients studied after MICU discharge (80 measurements), CHG skin concentrations fell below effective levels after 1-3 days. CONCLUSION: In MICU patients bathed daily with CHG, CHG concentration was inversely associated with microbial density on skin; residual antimicrobial activity on skin persisted up to 24 hours. Determination of CHG concentration on the skin of patients may be useful in monitoring the adequacy of skin cleansing by healthcare workers.},

  abstract = {In accordance with the Affordable Care Act, Medicare has instituted financial penalties for hospitals with 30-day readmission rates that exceed a predetermined value. Currently, this value only considers "excess" readmissions for myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia with a maximum fine being one per cent of total Medicare reimbursements. In 2015, this penalty will increase to three per cent and encompass more surgical diagnoses. We retrospectively reviewed a database of adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery treated at our institution in 2012 to establish whether patients with readmissions within 30 days of the index operation could have been managed more cost-effectively without readmission. A calculation of cost efficiency was performed to compare the net hospital profit for two scenarios: admitting patients versus hypothetical preventative measures. Of the 576 patients during the study period, a total of 68 (11.8\%) patients with unplanned 30-day readmissions were identified. Outpatient management was determined to have been feasible for 18 (26.5\%) patients. Whereas the calculated net profit for readmission was \$144,000, inclusion of Medicare's penalty resulted in a loss of \$11,950. A readmission reduction program with an annual cost exceeding \$11,950 would lead to financial loss. The financial implications of Medicare's readmission penalty alone necessitate the development of cost-effective strategies to reduce rehospitalization.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Mostly because of comorbidity and drugs consumption, older persons are often exposed to an increased risk of sub-optimal prescribing (SP). At present, few studies investigated the association between SP and long-term health outcomes. We examined the relation between SP and the risk of mortality and hospitalization in Italian older community-dwellers. METHODS: Older (65+ years) community-dwelling residents of a small town in Tuscany were enrolled in a longitudinal study. SP was defined as polypharmacy (use of 5+ drugs), prescription of inappropriate drugs (ID) according to Beers' criteria, and of potentially interacting drugs (PID), evaluated in 1995 and 1999. These three forms of SP were entered as time-dependent exposures into multivariable Cox regression analysis models, whose outcomes were mortality and hospitalizations through 2003. RESULTS: Of 1022 participants (mean age 73.0 +/- 6.8, 57\% women), 220 were evaluated in 1995, 234 in 1999 and 568 in both waves. In univariate analysis, mortality was two-fold higher in participants with polypharmacy (73.4/1000 person/years, 95\% CI 58.2-92.4 vs. 34.1, 95\% CI 29.7-39.2; p {$<$} 0.001) or PID (72.7/1000 person/years, 95\% CI 46.3-113.9 vs. 38.0, 95\% CI 33.5-43.1; p {$<$} 0.001), whereas it was unrelated to the presence of ID. Hospitalization rates were independent of any form of SP. In multivariable models, polypharmacy, ID, and PID were no longer associated with an increased risk of death, and ID predicted a slightly increased risk of hospitalizations (HR 1.03, 95\% CI 1.0-1.06, p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, SP was not associated with an excess risk of poor health outcomes.},

The study sample consisted of 284 veterans residing in Florida who had been hospitalized at least once for an avoidable reason. A bivariate probit model with instrumental variables was used to estimate the probability of rehospitalization. Veterans who had at least 1 ambulatory care visit per month experienced a significant reduction in the probability of rehospitalization for the same avoidable hospitalization condition. The findings suggest that ambulatory care can serve as an important substitute for more expensive hospitalization for the conditions characterized as avoidable.},

Antithrombotic and antidiabetic medications, diuretics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cause most of the preventable hospital admissions due to adverse drug events. Strategies to reduce the risk of adverse drug events include discontinuing medications, prescribing new medications sparingly, reducing the number of prescribers, and frequently reconciling medications. The Beers, STOPP (screening tool of older persons' potentially inappropriate prescriptions), and START (screening tool to alert doctors to right treatment) criteria can help identify medications causing adverse drug events. Not all potentially inappropriate medications can be avoided.

  abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a current global health problem. Resistant bacteria make it difficult to successfully treat severe infections, increasing the risk for complications and death from conditions that require treatment with antibiotics. By using antibiotics responsibly, we can reduce the development of antibiotic resistance. Correct usage of antibiotics demands a high level of public knowledge. The study presented here aimed to investigate attitudes and knowledge about antibiotics and antibiotic resistance in Sweden. In this study, a questionnaire was sent to 2500 randomly selected people between 18 and 74 years of age. The participants were asked to respond to statements and questions related to the following themes: their own use of antibiotics; access to antibiotics; effects of antibiotics; side-effects and resistance; and experiences and trust with regards to how infections are handled by health care professionals. A few demographic questions were included so that knowledge and attitudes could be compared between groups of people. Around two thirds of the selected people participated in the study and returned the filled out questionnaire. Among those with the lowest level of knowledge about antibiotics, most people said they did not know whether antibiotic resistance is a problem in Sweden and the rest of the world. A majority of all participants disagreed to the statement that you can save antibiotics for later and share them with other people. In addition, most people disagreed to the statement that it is good that antibiotics can be ordered over the internet without having to see a doctor. With regards to people's trust in doctors' decisions not to prescribe antibiotics, women had less trust than men and younger persons had less trust than older people. Participants with little knowledge about antibiotics and antibiotic resistance had less trust than those with a higher level of knowledge. General conclusions are that the participants were knowledgeable about rational use of antibiotics and that most of them trusted the doctor to decide whether antibiotics are needed. There seems to be an association between people's knowledge about the effects of antibiotics and resistance, and their trust in the doctor. The results indicate that people between 18 and 29 years might need more information about the effects of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. Information activities should therefore focus on young adults, while not excluding other age groups.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of two variables not previously studied in the readmissions literature (frailty-related diagnoses and high-risk medications in the elderly (HRME)) and one understudied variable (volume of primary care visits in the prior year). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using data from a study designed to examine outcomes associated with inappropriate prescribing in elderly adults. SETTING: All Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities with acute inpatient beds in fiscal year 2006 (FY06). PARTICIPANTS: All veterans aged 65 and older by October 1, 2005, who received VA care at least once per year between October 1, 2004, and September 30, 2006, and were hospitalized at least once during FY06 on a medical or surgical unit. MEASUREMENTS: A generalized linear interactive risk prediction model included demographic and clinical characteristics (mental health and chronic medical conditions, frailty-related diagnoses, number of medications) in FY05; incident HRME in FY06 before index hospitalization or readmission; chronic HRME in FY05; and FY05 emergency department (ED), hospital, geriatric, palliative, or primary care use. Facility-level variables were complexity, rural versus urban, and FY06 admission rate. RESULTS: The mean adjusted readmission rate was 18.3\%. The new frailty-related diagnoses variable is a risk factor for readmission in addition to Charlson comorbidity score. Incident HRME use was associated with lower rates of readmission, as were higher numbers of primary care visits in the prior year. CONCLUSION: Frailty-related diagnoses may help to target individuals at higher risk of readmission to receive more-intensive care transition services. HRME use does not help in this targeting. A higher number of face-to-face primary care visits in the prior year, unlike ED and hospital use, correlates with fewer readmissions and may be another avenue for targeting prevention strategies.},

One-hundred and twenty-five patients (median age 73) referred with COPD exacerbations met the criteria for the service; 95 received the intervention and data were available for 80. Median FEV1 was 0.86 L. Admission data, length of stay and total hospitalization days with COPD were compared for one year before and after the intervention. Overall there was no reduction in length of stay, admission frequency, or adjusted total hospitalization days with COPD, but median time interval to next exacerbation increased by 29\%. In those who had had previous admissions (mean FEV1 0.58 L) total hospitalization days fell by 27\%, length of stay fell by 58\% despite an increase in admission frequency from one to two per year, and there was no change in median time interval to next hospitalized exacerbation. In our patients implementation of a Chronic Disease Management programme increased the time to next hospitalized exacerbation. Benefit was seen in the more severe patients however, with a significant reduction in both length of stay and total hospitalization days.},

  abstract = {The health of a population is important from a public health and economic perspective as healthy individuals contribute to economic growth. Vaccination has the potential to contribute substantially to improving population health and thereby economic growth. Childhood vaccination programmes in Europe can offer protection against 15 important infectious diseases, thus preventing child fatalities and any serious temporary and permanent sequelae that can occur. Healthy children are more able to participate in education, thus preparing them to become healthy and productive adults. Vaccination programmes can also prevent infectious diseases in adolescents, thus allowing them to continue their development towards a healthy adulthood. Protecting adults against infectious diseases ensures that they can fully contribute to productivity and economic development by avoiding sick leave and lower productivity. Vaccination in older adults will contribute to the promotion of healthy ageing, enabling them to assist their familiy with, for instance, childcare, and also help them avoid functional decline and the related impacts on health and welfare expenditure. Effective vaccination programmes for all ages in Europe will thus contribute to the European Union's 2020 health and economic strategies. Indeed, beyond their impact on healthcare resources and productivity, reductions in mortality and morbidity also contribute to increased consumption and gross domestic product. Therefore, assessment of the value of vaccines and vaccination needs to consider not just the direct impact on health and healthcare but also the wider impact on economic growth, which requires a macroeconomic analysis of vaccination programmes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many health literacy instruments focus on reading skills, numeracy and/or information processing aspects only. In the Netherlands, as in other countries, the need for a comprehensive, person-centred measure of health literacy was observed and consequently the decision was made to translate the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) into Dutch. The HLQ has nine health literacy domains covering people's experiences and skills. This research sought to translate, culturally adapt and psychometrically test the HLQ. METHODS: The translation and adaptation was done using a systematic approach with forward translation guided by item intents, blind back translation, and a consensus meeting with the developer. The Dutch version of the HLQ was applied in a sample of non-hospitalized, chronically ill patients. Descriptive statistics were generated to describe mean, standard deviation and floor and ceiling effects for all items. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) model was fitted to the data. Scores on the nine domains of the HLQ were compared across demographic and illness characteristics as a form of known-groups validity. Psychometric analyses included Cronbach's alpha, item-rest and item-remainder correlations. RESULTS: Using CFA, the Dutch HLQ psychometric structure was found to strongly align with the hypothesised (original) nine independent domains of the English version. The nine scales were found to be highly reliable (all scales had alpha between 0.83 and 0.94). Six of the nine HLQ-scales had items that show ceiling-effects. There were no ceiling effects present at the scale level. Scores on the scales of the HLQ differed according to demographic and illness characteristics: people who were older, lower educated and living alone and patients with multiple chronic diseases generally scored lower. CONCLUSIONS: The Dutch version of the HLQ is a robust and reliable instrument that measures nine different domains of health literacy. The questionnaire was tested in a sample of chronically ill patients, and should be further tested in the general population as well as in different disease groups. The HLQ is a major addition to currently available instruments in the Netherlands, since it measures health literacy from a multi-dimensional perspective and builds on patients' experiences and skills.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medication nonadherence is increasingly recognized as a cause of preventable adverse events, hospitalizations, and poor healthcare outcomes. While comprehensive medication adherence assessment for the elderly is likely to identify and prevent drug-related problems, it is time consuming for patient and healthcare providers alike. OBJECTIVE: To identify screening tools to predict elderly patients' intended medication adherence that are suitable for primary-care settings and community pharmacies. METHODS: This study evaluated 57 English-speaking persons aged 65 years and older who were from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Intended adherence was quantified, and the relationships to demographic, medical history, socioeconomic, and literacy variables were determined. RESULTS: In a multivariate analysis with the composite MedTake Test (a quantitative measure of each subject's intent to adhere to prescribed oral medications) as the dependent variable, independent predictors of intended adherence included: age, car ownership in the last 10 years, receipt of food assistance in the last 10 years, number of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, and REALM (Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine). The strongest predictor was the REALM word-recognition pronunciation test (beta = 0.666; R2 = 0.271; p {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that the REALM word-recognition pronunciation test, along with age, number of OTC drugs, and 2 socioeconomic questions, predicted the intent of seniors to correctly take their own prescribed oral medications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An estimated 30 million neonates require inpatient care annually, many with life-threatening infections. Appropriate antibiotic management is  crucial, yet there is no routine measurement of coverage. The Every Newborn Birth  Indicators Research Tracking in Hospitals (EN-BIRTH) study aimed to validate  maternal and newborn indicators to inform measurement of coverage and quality of  care. This paper reports validation of reported antibiotic coverage by exit  survey of mothers for hospitalized newborns with clinically-defined infections,  including sepsis, meningitis, and pneumonia. METHODS: EN-BIRTH study was  conducted in five hospitals in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Tanzania (July 2017-July  2018). Neonates were included based on case definitions to focus on  term/near-term, clinically-defined infection syndromes (sepsis, meningitis, and  pneumonia), excluding major congenital abnormalities. Clinical management was  abstracted from hospital inpatient case notes (verification) which was considered  as the gold standard against which to validate accuracy of women's report. Exit  surveys were conducted using questions similar to The Demographic and Health  Surveys (DHS) approach for coverage of childhood pneumonia treatment. We compared  survey-report to case note verified, pooled across the five sites using random  effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1015 inpatient neonates admitted in  the five hospitals met inclusion criteria with clinically-defined infection  syndromes. According to case note verification, 96.7\% received an injectable  antibiotic, although only 14.5\% of them received the recommended course of at  least 7 days. Among women surveyed (n~=\,910), 98.8\% (95\% CI: 97.8-99.5\%)  correctly reported their baby was admitted to a neonatal ward. Only 47.1\%  (30.1-64.5\%) reported their baby's diagnosis in terms of sepsis, meningitis, or  pneumonia. Around three-quarters of women reported their baby received an  injection whilst in hospital, but 12.3\% reported the correct antibiotic name.  Only 10.6\% of the babies had a blood culture and less than 1\% had a lumbar  puncture. CONCLUSIONS: Women's report during exit survey consistently  underestimated the denominator (reporting the baby had an infection), and even  more so the numerator (reporting known injectable antibiotics). Admission to the  neonatal ward was accurately reported and may have potential as a contact point  indicator for use in household surveys, similar to institutional births.  Strengthening capacity and use of laboratory diagnostics including blood culture  are essential to promote appropriate use of antibiotics. To track quality of  neonatal infection management, we recommend using inpatient records to measure  specifics, requiring more research on standardised inpatient records.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Regeneration of the insulin-secreting beta-cells is a fundamental research goal that could benefit patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. beta-Cell proliferation can be acutely stimulated by a variety of stimuli in young rodents. However, it is unknown whether this adaptive beta-cell regeneration capacity is retained into old age. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed adaptive beta-cell proliferation capacity in adult mice across a wide range of ages with a variety of stimuli: partial pancreatectomy, low-dose administration of the beta-cell toxin streptozotocin, and exendin-4, a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist. beta-Cell proliferation was measured by administration of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) in the drinking water. RESULTS: Basal beta-cell proliferation was severely decreased with advanced age. Partial pancreatectomy greatly stimulated beta-cell proliferation in young mice but failed to increase beta-cell replication in old mice. Streptozotocin stimulated beta-cell replication in young mice but had little effect in old mice. Moreover, administration of GLP-1 agonist exendin-4 stimulated beta-cell proliferation in young but not in old mice. Surprisingly, adaptive beta-cell proliferation capacity was minimal after 12 months of age, which is early middle age for the adult mouse life span. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive beta-cell proliferation is severely restricted with advanced age in mice, whether stimulated by partial pancreatectomy, low-dose streptozotocin, or exendin-4. Thus, beta-cells in middle-aged mice appear to be largely postmitotic. Young rodents may not faithfully model the regenerative capacity of beta-cells in mature adult mice.},

  abstract = {Background The associations of blood pressure with the different manifestations of incident cardiovascular disease in a contemporary population have not been compared. In this study, we aimed to analyse the associations of blood pressure with 12 different presentations of cardiovascular disease. Methods We used linked electronic health records from 1997 to 2010 in the CALIBER (CArdiovascular research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records) programme to assemble a cohort of 1{$\cdot$}25 million patients, 30 years of age or older and initially free from cardiovascular disease, a fifth of whom received blood pressure-lowering treatments. We studied the heterogeneity in the age-specific associations of clinically measured blood pressure with 12 acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases, and estimated the lifetime risks (up to 95 years of age) and cardiovascular disease-free life-years lost adjusted for other risk factors at index ages 30, 60, and 80 years. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01164371. Findings During 5{$\cdot$}2 years median follow-up, we recorded 83\hphantom{,}098 initial cardiovascular disease presentations. In each age group, the lowest risk for cardiovascular disease was in people with systolic blood pressure of 90--114 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 60--74 mm Hg, with no evidence of a J-shaped increased risk at lower blood pressures. The effect of high blood pressure varied by cardiovascular disease endpoint, from strongly positive to no effect. Associations with high systolic blood pressure were strongest for intracerebral haemorrhage (hazard ratio 1{$\cdot$}44 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}32--1{$\cdot$}58]), subarachnoid haemorrhage (1{$\cdot$}43 [1{$\cdot$}25--1{$\cdot$}63]), and stable angina (1{$\cdot$}41 [1{$\cdot$}36--1{$\cdot$}46]), and weakest for abdominal aortic aneurysm (1{$\cdot$}08 [1{$\cdot$}00--1{$\cdot$}17]). Compared with diastolic blood pressure, raised systolic blood pressure had a greater effect on angina, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial disease, whereas raised diastolic blood pressure had a greater effect on abdominal aortic aneurysm than did raised systolic pressure. Pulse pressure associations were inverse for abdominal aortic aneurysm (HR per 10 mm Hg 0{$\cdot$}91 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}86--0{$\cdot$}98]) and strongest for peripheral arterial disease (1{$\cdot$}23 [1{$\cdot$}20--1{$\cdot$}27]). People with hypertension (blood pressure {$\geq$}140/90 mm Hg or those receiving blood pressure-lowering drugs) had a lifetime risk of overall cardiovascular disease at 30 years of age of 63{$\cdot$}3\% (95\% CI 62{$\cdot$}9--63{$\cdot$}8) compared with 46{$\cdot$}1\% (45{$\cdot$}5--46{$\cdot$}8) for those with normal blood pressure, and developed cardiovascular disease 5{$\cdot$}0 years earlier (95\% CI 4{$\cdot$}8--5{$\cdot$}2). Stable and unstable angina accounted for most (43\%) of the cardiovascular disease-free years of life lost associated with hypertension from index age 30 years, whereas heart failure and stable angina accounted for the largest proportion (19\% each) of years of life lost from index age 80 years. Interpretation The widely held assumptions that blood pressure has strong associations with the occurrence of all cardiovascular diseases across a wide age range, and that diastolic and systolic associations are concordant, are not supported by the findings of this high-resolution study. Despite modern treatments, the lifetime burden of hypertension is substantial. These findings emphasise the need for new blood pressure-lowering strategies, and will help to inform the design of randomised trials to assess them.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health literacy presents an enormous challenge in the delivery of effective healthcare and quality outcomes. We evaluated the impact of low health literacy (LHL) on healthcare utilization and healthcare expenditure. METHODS: Database analysis used Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) from 2005-2008 which provides nationally representative estimates of healthcare utilization and expenditure. Health literacy scores (HLSs) were calculated based on a validated, predictive model and were scored according to the National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL). HLS ranged from 0-500. Health literacy level (HLL) and categorized in 2 groups: Below basic or basic (HLS {$<$}226) and above basic (HLS {$>$}/=226). Healthcare utilization expressed as a physician, nonphysician, or emergency room (ER) visits and healthcare spending. Expenditures were adjusted to 2010 rates using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). A P value of 0.05 or less was the criterion for statistical significance in all analyses. Multivariate regression models assessed the impact of the predicted HLLs on outpatient healthcare utilization and expenditures. All analyses were performed with SAS and STATA(R) 11.0 statistical software. RESULTS: The study evaluated 22 599 samples representing 503 374 648 weighted individuals nationally from 2005-2008. The cohort had an average age of 49 years and included more females (57\%). Caucasian were the predominant racial ethnic group (83\%) and 37\% of the cohort were from the South region of the United States of America. The proportion of the cohort with basic or below basic health literacy was 22.4\%. Annual predicted values of physician visits, nonphysician visits, and ER visits were 6.6, 4.8, and 0.2, respectively, for basic or below basic compared to 4.4, 2.6, and 0.1 for above basic. Predicted values of office and ER visits expenditures were \$1284 and \$151, respectively, for basic or below basic and \$719 and \$100 for above basic (P {$<$} .05). The extrapolated national estimates show that the annual costs for prescription alone for adults with LHL possibly associated with basic and below basic health literacy could potentially reach about \$172 billion. CONCLUSION: Health literacy is inversely associated with healthcare utilization and expenditure. Individuals with below basic or basic HLL have greater healthcare utilization and expendituresspending more on prescriptions compared to individuals with above basic HLL. Public health strategies promoting appropriate education among individuals with LHL may help to improve health outcomes and reduce unnecessary healthcare visits and costs.},

METHODS: Data from the MRC National Survey for Health and Development were analysed to determine the prevalence and composition of polypharmacy at age 69 and changes since ages 60 to 64. Multinomial regression was used to test associations between gender, education and occupational social class and total, cardiological and non-cardiological polypharmacy controlling for disease burden. RESULTS: At age 69, 22.8\% of individuals were taking more than 5 medications. There was an increase in the use of 5 to 8 medications (+ 2.3\%) and over 9 medications (+ 0.8\%) between ages 60-64 and 69. The greatest increases were found for cardiovascular (+ 13.4\%) and gastrointestinal medications (+ 7.3\%). Men experienced greater cardiological polypharmacy, women greater non-cardiological polypharmacy. Higher levels of education were associated with lower polypharmacy independent of disease burden, with strongest effects seen for over five cardiological medications (RRR 0.3, 95\% CI 0.2-0.5 p {$<$} 0.001 for advanced secondary qualifications compared with no qualification); there was no additional effect of social class. CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy increased over the seventh decade. Those with lower levels of education had more polypharmacy (total, cardiological and non-cardiological), even allowing for disease burden. Further analysis of future outcomes resulting from polypharmacy should take into account educational and gender differences, in an effort to identify at-risk populations who could benefit from medication reviews.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate longitudinal associations between polypharmacy and cognitive and physical capability and to determine whether these associations differ with cumulative exposure to polypharmacy. DESIGN: Prospective birth cohort study. SETTING: England, Scotland, and Wales. PARTICIPANTS: An eligible sample of men and women from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development with medication data at age 69 (N=2,122, 79\%). MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive capability was assessed using a word learning test, visual search speed task, and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination, Third Edition (ACE-III). Physical capability was measured using chair rise speed, standing balance time, walking speed, and grip strength. RESULTS: Polypharmacy (5-8 prescribed medications) was present in 18.2\% of participants at age 69 and excessive polypharmacy ({$\geq$}9 prescribed medications) in 4.7\%. Both were associated with poorer cognitive and physical capability in models adjusted for sex, education, and disease burden. Stronger associations were found for excessive polypharmacy (e.g., difference in mean ACE-III scores comparing polypharmacy=-2.0, 95\% CI=-2.8 to -1.1 and excessive polypharmacy=-2.9, 95\% CI=-4.4 to -1.4 with no polypharmacy). Participants with polypharmacy at age 60 to 64 and at age 69 showed stronger Negative associations with cognitive and physical capability were stronger still in participants with polypharmacy at both age 60 to 64 and at age 69 (e.g. difference in mean chair rise speed, comparing polypharmacy with no polypharmacy at both ages=-3.9, 95\% CI=-5.2 to -2.6 and at age 60-64 only=-2.5, 95\% CI=-4.1 to -0.9). CONCLUSION: Polypharmacy at age 60 to 64 and age 69 was associated with poorer physical and cognitive capability, even after adjusting for disease burden. Stronger negative associations were seen in participants with longstanding polypharmacy, suggesting a cumulative, dose-dependent relationship (where dose is the number of prescribed medications). Future research aiming to improve cognitive and physical capability should consider interventions to reduce the duration and level of polypharmacy at younger ages, in addition to optimizing disease control with appropriate medications.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE The association between socioeconomic status and survival based on all-cause, cardiovascular (CV), diabetes-related, and cancer mortality in type 2 diabetes has not been examined in a setting of persons with equitable access to health care with adjustment for important confounders. OBJECTIVE To determine whether income, educational level, marital status, and country of birth are independently associated with all-cause, CV, diabetes-related, and cancer mortality in persons with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A study including all 217 364 individuals younger than 70 years with type 2 diabetes in the Sweden National Diabetes Register (January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2010) who were monitored through December 31, 2012, was conducted. A Cox proportional hazards regression model with up to 17 covariates was used for analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause, CV, diabetes-related, and cancer mortality. RESULTS Of the 217 364 persons included in the study, mean (SD) age was 58.3 (9.3) years and 130 839 of the population (60.2\%) was male. There were a total of 19 105 all-cause deaths with 11 423 (59.8\%), 6984 (36.6\%), and 6438 (33.7\%) CV, diabetes-related, or cancer deaths, respectively. Compared with being single, hazard ratios (HRs) for married individuals, determined using fully adjusted models, for all-cause, CV, and diabetes-related mortality were 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.70-0.77), 0.67 (95\% CI, 0.63-0.71), and 0.62 (95\% CI, 0.57-0.67), respectively. Marital status was not associated with overall cancer mortality, but married men had a 33\% lower risk of prostate cancer mortality compared with single men, with an HR of 0.67 (95\% CI, 0.50-0.90). Comparison of HRs for the lowest vs highest income quintiles for all-cause, CV, diabetes-related, and cancer mortality were 1.71 (95\% CI, 1.60-1.83), 1.87 (95\% CI, 1.72-2.05), 1.80 (95\% CI, 1.61-2.01), and 1.28 (95\% CI, 1.14-1.44), respectively. Compared with native Swedes, HRs for all-cause, CV, diabetes-related, and cancer mortality for non-Western immigrants were 0.55 (95\% CI, 0.48-0.63), 0.46 (95\% CI, 0.38-0.56), 0.38 (95\% CI, 0.29-0.49), and 0.72 (95\% CI, 0.58-0.88), respectively, and these HRs were virtually unaffected by covariate adjustment. Hazard ratios for those with a college/university degree compared with 9 years or less of education were 0.85 (95\% CI, 0.80-0.90), 0.84 (95\% CI, 0.78-0.91), and 0.84 (95\% CI, 0.76-0.93) for all-cause, CV, and cancer mortality, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Independent of risk factors, access to health care, and use of health care, socioeconomic status is a powerful predictor of all-cause and CV mortality but was not as strong as a predictor of death from cancer.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Studies on ethnic disparities in glycaemic control have been contradictory, and compromised by excessively broad categories of ethnicity and inadequate adjustment for socioeconomic differences. We aimed to study the effect of ethnicity on glycaemic control in a large cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes. Setting: We used nationwide data (mainly from primary care) from the Swedish National Diabetes Register (2002--2011) to identify patients with newly diagnosed (within 12 months) type 2 diabetes. Participants: We included 131 935 patients (with 713 495 appointments), representing 10 ethnic groups, who were followed up to 10 years. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Progress of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) for up to 10 years was examined. Mixed models were used to correlate ethnicity with HbA1c (mmol/mol). The effect of glycaemic disparities was examined by assessing the risk of developing albuminuria. The impact of ethnicity was compared to that of income, education and physical activity. Results: Immigrants, particularly those of non-Western origin, received glucose-lowering therapy earlier, had 30\% more appointments but displayed poorer glycaemic control (2--5 mmol/mol higher HbA1c than native Swedes). Probability of therapy failure was 28--111\% higher for non-Western groups than for native Swedes. High-income Western groups remained below the target-level of HbA1c for 4--5 years, whereas non-Western populations never reached the target level. These disparities translated into 51--92\% higher risk of developing albuminuria. The impact of ethnicity was greater than the effect of income and education, and equal to the effect of physical activity.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: People with type 1 diabetes are at elevated risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease, yet current guidelines do not consider age of onset as an important risk stratifier. We aimed to examine how age at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes relates to excess mortality and cardiovascular risk. METHODS: We did a nationwide, register-based cohort study of individuals with type 1 diabetes in the Swedish National Diabetes Register and matched controls from the general population. We included patients with at least one registration between Jan 1, 1998, and Dec 31, 2012. Using Cox regression, and with adjustment for diabetes duration, we estimated the excess risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular disease (a composite of acute myocardial infarction and stroke), coronary heart disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. Individuals with type 1 diabetes were categorised into five groups, according to age at diagnosis: 0-10 years, 11-15 years, 16-20 years, 21-25 years, and 26-30 years. FINDINGS: 27\hphantom{,}195 individuals with type 1 diabetes and 135\hphantom{,}178 matched controls were selected for this study. 959 individuals with type 1 diabetes and 1501 controls died during follow-up (median follow-up was 10 years). Patients who developed type 1 diabetes at 0-10 years of age had hazard ratios of 4{$\cdot$}11 (95\% CI 3{$\cdot$}24-5{$\cdot$}22) for all-cause mortality, 7{$\cdot$}38 (3{$\cdot$}65-14{$\cdot$}94) for cardiovascular mortality, 3{$\cdot$}96 (3{$\cdot$}06-5{$\cdot$}11) for non-cardiovascular mortality, 11{$\cdot$}44 (7{$\cdot$}95-16{$\cdot$}44) for cardiovascular disease, 30{$\cdot$}50 (19{$\cdot$}98-46{$\cdot$}57) for coronary heart disease, 30{$\cdot$}95 (17{$\cdot$}59-54{$\cdot$}45) for acute myocardial infarction, 6{$\cdot$}45 (4{$\cdot$}04-10{$\cdot$}31) for stroke, 12{$\cdot$}90 (7{$\cdot$}39-22{$\cdot$}51) for heart failure, and 1{$\cdot$}17 (0{$\cdot$}62-2{$\cdot$}20) for atrial fibrillation. Corresponding hazard ratios for individuals who developed type 1 diabetes aged 26-30 years were 2{$\cdot$}83 (95\% CI 2{$\cdot$}38-3{$\cdot$}37) for all-cause mortality, 3{$\cdot$}64 (2{$\cdot$}34-5{$\cdot$}66) for cardiovascular mortality, 2{$\cdot$}78 (2{$\cdot$}29-3{$\cdot$}38) for non-cardiovascular mortality, 3{$\cdot$}85 (3{$\cdot$}05-4{$\cdot$}87) for cardiovascular disease, 6{$\cdot$}08 (4{$\cdot$}71-7{$\cdot$}84) for coronary heart disease, 5{$\cdot$}77 (4{$\cdot$}08-8{$\cdot$}16) for acute myocardial infarction, 3{$\cdot$}22 (2{$\cdot$}35-4{$\cdot$}42) for stroke, 5{$\cdot$}07 (3{$\cdot$}55-7{$\cdot$}22) for heart failure, and 1{$\cdot$}18 (0{$\cdot$}79-1{$\cdot$}77) for atrial fibrillation; hence the excess risk differed by up to five times across the diagnosis age groups. The highest overall incidence rate, noted for all-cause mortality, was 1{$\cdot$}9 (95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}71-2{$\cdot$}11) per 100\hphantom{,}000 person-years for people with type 1 diabetes. Development of type 1 diabetes before 10 years of age resulted in a loss of 17{$\cdot$}7 life-years (95\% CI 14{$\cdot$}5-20{$\cdot$}4) for women and 14{$\cdot$}2 life-years (12{$\cdot$}1-18{$\cdot$}2) for men. INTERPRETATION: Age at onset of type 1 diabetes is an important determinant of survival, as well as all cardiovascular outcomes, with highest excess risk in women. Greater focus on cardioprotection might be warranted in people with early-onset type 1 diabetes. FUNDING: Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of early (in 14 days or less) readmissions to the hospital, and to identify risk factors for readmission. DESIGN: Matched case-control. Cases (n = 155) were readmitted to the hospital within 14 days of a hospital discharge, while controls (n = 155) were not. Controls and cases were matched by week of hospital discharge. PATIENTS: Two-year sequential sample of male veterans aged 65 years and over admitted to the Seattle Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. MEASUREMENTS: Data about 31 potential risk factors were abstracted from the medical records. RESULTS: Three risk factors associated with readmission risk were identified and include two or more hospital admissions in the previous year [odds ratio (OR) = 3.06], any medication dosage change in the 48 hours prior to discharge (OR = 2.34), and a visiting nurse referral for follow-up (OR = 2.78). One protective factor--discharge from the geriatric evaluation unit (GEU) (OR = 0.09)--was also determined. CONCLUSIONS: Early unplanned readmissions were frequent at this VA facility. Since the strongest risk factor for readmission was the number of admissions in the previous year, readmissions appeared most commonly among high utilizers of inpatient VA care. This risk factor and others may be useful in identifying a group at high readmission risk, which could be targeted in intervention studies. The reduced readmission rate associated with the GEU suggests one potential intervention to decrease readmission risk.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biomarkers may enhance diagnostic capability for common paediatric infections, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where standard  diagnostic modalities are frequently unavailable, but disease burden is high. A  comprehensive understanding of the diagnostic capability of commonly available  biomarkers for neonatal sepsis in LMICs is lacking. Our objective was to  systematically review evidence on biomarkers to understand their diagnostic  performance for neonatal sepsis in LMICs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic  review and meta-analysis of studies published in English, Spanish, French,  German, Dutch, and Arabic reporting the diagnostic performance of C reactive  protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood cell count (WBC)  and procalcitonin (PCT) for neonatal sepsis. We calculated pooled test  characteristics and the area under the curve (AUC) for each biomarker compared  with the reference standards blood culture or clinical sepsis defined by each  article. RESULTS: Of 6570 studies related to biomarkers in children, 134 met  inclusion criteria and included 23\,179 neonates. There were 80 (59.7\%) studies  conducted in LMICs. CRP of {$\geq$}60\,mg/L (AUC 0.87, 95\% CI 0.76 to 0.91) among 1339  neonates and PCT of {$\geq$}0.5\,ng/mL (AUC 0.87, 95\% CI 0.70 to 0.92) among 617 neonates  demonstrated the greatest discriminatory value for the diagnosis of neonatal  sepsis using blood culture as the reference standard in LMICs. CONCLUSIONS: PCT  and CRP had good discriminatory value for neonatal sepsis in LMICs. ESR and WBC  demonstrated poor discrimination for neonatal sepsis in LMICs. Future studies may  incorporate biomarkers into clinical evaluation in LMICs to diagnose neonatal  sepsis more accurately. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020188680.},

DESIGN: Review of Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) hospital utilisation data. SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Tertiary data from all Australian public and private hospitals for the financial years 1993-94 to 2019-20. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers and population-based rates of hospital separations and bed utilisation (bed-days) (all and multiple day admissions) and mean hospital length of day (multiple day admissions), overall and by age group (under 65 years, 65-74 years, 75 years or more). RESULTS: Between 1993-94 and 2019-20, the Australian population grew by 44\%; the number of people aged 75 years or more increased from 4.6\% to 6.9\% of the population. The annual number of hospital separations increased from 4.61\,million to 11.33\,million (146\% increase); the annual hospital separation rate increased from 261 to 435 per 1000 people (66\% increase), most markedly for people aged 75 years or more (from 745 to 1441 per 1000 people; 94\% increase). Total bed utilisation increased from 21.0\,million to 29.9 million bed-days (42\% increase), but the bed utilisation rate did not change markedly (1993-94, 1192 bed-days per 1000 people; 2019-20, 1179 bed-days per 1000 people), primarily because the mean hospital length of stay for multiple day admissions declined from 6.6 days to 5.4 days; for people aged 75 years or more it declined from 12.2 to 7.1 days. However, declines in stay length have slowed markedly since 2017-18. Total bed utilisation was 16.8\% lower than projected from 1993-94 rates, and was 37.3\% lower for people aged 75 years or more. CONCLUSION: Hospital bed utilisation rates declined although admission rates increased during 1993-94 to 2019-20; the proportion of beds occupied by people aged 75 years or more increased slightly during this period. Containing hospital costs by limiting bed availability and reducing length of stay may no longer be a viable strategy.},

We present here a simple approach to the analysis of such data using an appropriately weighted regression model. Viewing the problem as a two-stage design provides a unified framework for recognizing and defining the necessary weights when confronted with a variety of real data problems that at first seem unrelated. We provide illustrations that highlight the generality of the approach and demonstrate that the method gives essentially the same results as more specialized methods that require non-standard tools for analysis.},

Previous interventions in this population have shown mixed results. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a nurse-managed telephone-based case-management intervention can reduce healthcare utilization and improve self-assessed health status in frequent emergency department users. METHODS: We carried out a Zelen-design randomized-controlled trial among patients who were identified as frequent emergency department users ({$\geq$} 3 visits during the 6 months before inclusion) at the Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm (Sweden). Patients included in the study (n = 268) were randomized to either the intervention group or the control group and followed for 1 year. Patients who declined to participate or could not be reached were also followed for the study outcome. RESULTS: The telephone-based case-management intervention reduced the total number of outpatient visits (relative risk 0.80; 95\% confidence interval 0.75-0.84), the number of emergency department visits (relative risk 0.77; 95\% confidence interval 0.69-0.86), the number of days patients were admitted to hospitals as well as the total healthcare costs for hospital admissions. There was no difference in mortality or other identified adverse outcomes between the intervention and the control groups. Patient self-assessed health status improved for the patients who received the case-management intervention. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the nurse-managed telephone-based case-management intervention represents a possible strategy to improve care for frequent emergency department users as well as decrease outpatient visits, admission days and healthcare costs.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to develop a European list of potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) for older people, which can be used for the analysis and comparison of prescribing patterns across European countries and for clinical practice. METHODS: A preliminary PIM list was developed, based on the German PRISCUS list of potentially inappropriate medications and other PIM lists from the USA, Canada and France. Thirty experts on geriatric prescribing from Estonia, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden participated; eight experts performed a structured expansion of the list, suggesting further medications; twenty-seven experts participated in a two-round Delphi survey assessing the appropriateness of drugs and suggesting dose adjustments and therapeutic alternatives. Finally, twelve experts completed a brief final survey to decide upon issues requiring further consensus. RESULTS: Experts reached a consensus that 282 chemical substances or drug classes from 34 therapeutic groups are PIM for older people; some PIM are restricted to a certain dose or duration of use. The PIM list contains suggestions for dose adjustments and therapeutic alternatives. CONCLUSIONS: The European Union (EU)(7)-PIM list is a screening tool, developed with participation of experts from seven European countries, that allows identification and comparison of PIM prescribing patterns for older people across European countries. It can also be used as a guide in clinical practice, although it does not substitute the decision-making process of individualised prescribing for older people. Further research is needed to investigate the feasibility and applicability and, finally, the clinical benefits of the newly developed list.},

We tested this association in the British 1946 birth cohort, which assessed IQ at age eight years and ascertained the metabolic syndrome at age 53~years based on modified (non-fasting blood) ATPIII criteria. Childhood IQ was inversely associated with risk of the metabolic syndrome, but this association was almost entirely mediated by educational attainment and achieved occupational social class. This may be consistent with a pattern where childhood IQ is strongly associated with outcomes that reflect neurological disorder, such as the degenerative dementias, but less so with common chronic physical diseases of ageing.},

Second, to investigate the association between HL and the knowledge and behavior relevant for preventing spread of the virus. Third, to explore variables associated with HRQoL in a pandemic environment. METHODS: This cross-sectional study includes survey data from 2,205 Norwegian adolescents 16-19 years of age. The participants reported on their health information sources, HL, handwashing knowledge and behavior, number of social interactions, and HRQoL. Associations between study variables and specified outcomes were explored using multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Television (TV) and family were indicated to be the main sources for pandemic-related health information. Handwashing, physical distancing, and limiting the number of social contacts were the most frequently reported measures. HL and handwashing knowledge and HL and handwashing behavior were significantly associated. For each unit increase on the HL scale, the participants were 5\% more likely to socialize less with friends in comparison to normal. The mean HRQoL was very poor compared to European norms. Being quarantined or isolated and having confirmed or suspected Covid-19 were significantly negatively associated with HRQoL, but seeing less friends than normal was not associated. HL was significantly positively associated with HRQoL, albeit of minor clinical importance. CONCLUSION: Adolescents follow the health authorities' guidelines and appear highly literate. However, high fidelity requires great sacrifice because the required measures seem to collide with certain aspects that are important for the adolescents' HRQoL.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is broad consensus that countries need to develop and implement person-centred integrated care to better meet the needs of their growing populations with multimorbidity. To develop appropriate care, it is essential to know the needs for care and support among these populations. For this purpose, we examined whether subgroups of people with multimorbidity could be distinguished based on their needs, and profiled these subgroups according to medical complexity and the availability of personal resources. METHODS: Persons diagnosed with two or more somatic chronic diseases (N~=\,613) were selected from 38 general practices throughout the Netherlands. We conducted a cluster analysis of their scores on the RAND-36 questionnaire of health-related quality of life (QoL), to gain insight in their needs for care and support. Differences in demographics, medical characteristics and personal resources between the identified clusters were tested using analysis of variance and chi-square tests. RESULTS: The cluster analysis revealed three subgroups: 1. a group with a relatively good QoL (48\% of the sample), 2. a group with a poor physical QoL (28\%), and 3. a group with a poor QoL in all domains assessed by the RAND-36 (24\%). The group with a relatively good QoL had more favourable medical characteristics than the other groups, i.e., less chronic diseases, shorter illness duration, more stable course of illness, better controllable conditions, less polypharmacy. The group with a poor QoL in all domains could rely on less personal resources (education, income, social support, health literacy, self-management capabilities) than the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Different subgroups of people with multimorbidity can be distinguished based on their needs for care and support. These needs are not only determined by demographic and medical characteristics, but also by the personal resources people have available to manage their health and care. Patient profiles combining medical complexity and personal resources could guide the development of integrated care for specific target groups of persons with multimorbidity.},

A representative systematic sample comprised 1 148 propositi (521 males and 627 females). The study comprised a homecall part regarding basic personal data, dwelling conditions, economy, social and physical communications, previous migration, educational level, previous and any present professions, need for care, consumption of health care and drugs. Observations and measurements were done of illumination at the habitual site of reading, and a simple test of visual acuity was performed. Later on, examinations at the Out-patient Department of the Geriatric Hospital were performed, comprising in all probands general medical and ophthalmological examination, blood and urine sampling, ECG and X-ray of heart, lungs, and breasts and on subsamples, psychological, psychiatric, dental, somatometric, and audiometric examination. Furthermore, a dietary interview and a body composition examination were performed on subsamples. This first presentation deals with the design and procedure of the study, analysis of observer variation and a comparison between responders (85\%) and non-responders (15\%).

Methods Retrospective population-based study of patients with Type 2 diabetes identified in computerized medical records at 26 county primary care centres. Prevalence and incidence of Type 2 diabetes were estimated in the population aged 30--39, 40--49, 50--59, 60--69, 70--79 and {$\geq$} 80 years. Mortality, prevalence and incidence of complications in patients with Type 2 diabetes were determined through linkage to national inpatient, uraemia and cause-of-death registers. Results Crude prevalence of Type 2 diabetes increased from 2.2 to 3.5\% between 1996 and 2003. In the population aged {$\geq$} 30 years, the age- and sex-adjusted period increase was 53\%[odds ratio (OR) 1.53, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.47--1.58]. Crude population incidence was approximately stable after 1997 (3.7 cases/1000 residents in 1997 compared with 3.8/1000 in 2003). Age- and sex-adjusted mortality rates in Type 2 diabetic patients decreased by 4\% per year (OR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.94--0.97). Prevalence rates of cardiovascular disease in Type 2 diabetic patients were essentially stable, affecting 13.8\% of females and 18.0\% of males in 2003. No trend was detected for prevalence of renal failure or incidence of acute myocardial infarction, stroke and amputation. Conclusions Prevalence of Type 2 diabetes increased in Uppsala county between 1996 and 2003 as a consequence of approximately stable incidence since 1997 and declining mortality. Rates of diabetes-related complications, notably cardiovascular disease, continued to impose a substantial burden.},

Grip strength is recommended as a good simple measure of muscle strength when 'measured in standard conditions'. However, standard conditions remain to be defined. METHODS: a literature search was conducted to review articles describing the measurement of grip strength listed in Medline, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases up to 31 December 2009. RESULTS: there is wide variability in the choice of equipment and protocol for measuring grip strength. The Jamar hand dynamometer is the most widely used instrument with established test-retest, inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. However, there is considerable variation in how it is used and studies often provide insufficient information on the protocol followed making comparisons difficult. There is evidence that variation in approach can affect the values recorded. Furthermore, reported summary measures of grip strength vary widely including maximum or mean value, from one, two or three attempts, with either hand or the dominant hand alone. CONCLUSIONS: there is considerable variation in current methods of assessing grip strength which makes comparison between studies difficult. A standardised method would enable more consistent measurement of grip strength and better assessment of sarcopenia. Our approach is described.},

  abstract = {Hospital readmission rates among the elderly are attracting increasing attention. Readmission is costly, especially as proposed new guidelines could deny reimbursement for readmissions. Identifying key factors at discharge that can serve as prognostic indicators for readmission is an important step toward developing and targeting interventions to reduce hospital readmissions rates. Published literature has listed predominantly demographic, clinical, and health care utilization characteristics to describe the factors that put the elderly at risk. However, additional factors are proposed that include social, clinical, individual-level, environmental, and system-level factors. Multimodal interventions have been tested and some reduction in readmissions has been shown. Whether these additional factors might lead to a further reduction remains unclear. In addition to possible factors at discharge, factors identified after the patient has been discharged also must be identified and addressed. The patient safety literature characterizes factors that put the elderly at risk for adverse drug events, which function as antecedent factors for readmission and likely include the environmental and system-level factors. Synthesizing these factors from the readmission and patient safety literature provides the basis to develop a more comprehensive conceptual framework to identify research gaps aimed at reducing hospital readmissions among the elderly.},

Previous research indicates that a proportion of these hospital admissions could have been avoided. The objective of this study was to establish the extent and cost of potentially avoidable hospital admissions among patients with palliative care needs. METHODS: A prospective survey of hospital inpatients was undertaken to identify patients who met clinical criteria indicating palliative care need. Case notes were reviewed by two expert palliative care clinicians to determine if the hospital admission was potentially avoidable. An analysis of the cost of potentially avoidable admissions compared to all other admissions for those patients identified as being in the last year of life was carried out using the statistical analysis software R V.2.15.1. Logistic regression was performed using the logit (log of OR) link. The binary outcome of the logistic regression model was a potentially avoidable admission. RESULTS: Of the 99 patients who met the criteria for palliative care need, 22 were deemed to have experienced a potentially avoidable admission. Those living in a residential aged care facility were more at risk of experiencing such admissions. The mean total cost of hospital care for those with palliative care needs was lower for those whose admission was deemed potentially avoidable. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of patients with palliative care needs experience a potentially avoidable admission. Although these admissions are relatively short compared to those whose admissions are unavoidable, any hospital admission impacts on the experiences of patients and families and may contribute to unnecessary hospital expenditure.}

Risk assessment tools have been developed to identify patients at high risk of hospital readmission so they can be targeted for interventions aimed at reducing the rate of readmission. One such tool is the HOSPITAL score that uses seven readily available clinical variables to predict the risk of readmission within 30 days of discharge. The HOSPITAL score has been internationally validated in large academic medical centers. This study aims to determine if the HOSPITAL score is similarly useful in a moderate sized university affiliated hospital in the midwestern United States.{\textbar}All adult medical patients discharged from the SIU-SOM Hospitalist service from Memorial Medical Center (MMC) from October 15, 2015 to March 16, 2016, were studied retrospectively to determine if the HOSPITAL score was a significant predictor of hospital readmission within 30 days.{\textbar}During the study period, 998 discharges were recorded for the hospitalist service. The analysis includes data for the 931 discharges. Patients who died during the hospital stay, were transferred to another hospital, or left against medical advice were excluded. Of these patients, 109 (12\%) were readmitted to the same hospital within 30 days. The patients who were readmitted were more likely to have a length of stay greater than or equal to 5 days (55\% vs. 41\%, p = 0.005) and were more likely to have been admitted more than once to the hospital within the last year (100\% vs. 49\%, p {$<$} 0.001). A receiver operating characteristic evaluation of the HOSPITAL score for this patient population shows a C statistic of 0.77 (95\% CI [0.73-0.81]), indicating good discrimination for hospital readmission. The Brier score for the HOSPITAL score in this setting was 0.10, indicating good overall performance. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test shows a {$\chi$} (2) value of 1.63 with a p value of 0.20.{\textbar}This single center retrospective study indicates that the HOSPITAL score has good discriminatory ability to predict hospital readmissions within 30 days for a medical hospitalist service at a university-affiliated hospital. This data for all causes of hospital readmission is comparable to the discriminatory ability of the HOSPITAL score in the international validation study (C statistics of 0.72 vs. 0.77) conducted at considerably larger hospitals (975 average beds vs. 507 at MMC) for potentially avoidable hospital readmissions.{\textbar}The internationally validated HOSPITAL score may be a useful tool in moderate sized community hospitals to identify patients at high risk of hospital readmission within 30 days. This easy to use scoring system using readily available data can be used as part of interventional strategies to reduce the rate of hospital readmission.},

Of these patients, 35 (8\%) were readmitted to the same hospital within 30 days. A receiver operating characteristic evaluation of the HOSPITAL score for this patient population shows a C statistic of 0.75 (95\% CI [0.67-0.83]), indicating good discrimination for hospital readmission. The Brier score for the HOSPITAL score in this setting was 0.069, indicating good overall performance. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test shows a {$\chi$}(2) value of 3.71 with a p value of 0.59. A receiver operating characteristic evaluation of the LACE index for this patient population shows a C statistic of 0.58 (95\% CI [0.48-0.68]), indicating poor discrimination for hospital readmission. The Brier score for the LACE index in this setting was 0.082, indicating good overall performance. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test shows a {$\chi$}(2) value of 4.97 with a p value of 0.66.{\textbar}This single center retrospective study indicates that the HOSPITAL score has superior discriminatory ability when compared to the LACE index as a predictor of hospital readmission within 30 days at a medium-sized university-affiliated teaching hospital.{\textbar}The internationally validated HOSPITAL score may be superior to the LACE index in moderate-sized community hospitals to identify patients at high risk of hospital readmission within 30 days.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal mortality. New interventions are needed to decrease neonatal sepsis and mortality in regions  with highest burden. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of intrapartum  azithromycin to reduce neonatal sepsis or mortality, as well as neonatal and  maternal infections. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-blind,  placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial enrolled and followed up birthing  parents and their infants at 10 health facilities in The Gambia and Burkina Faso,  West Africa, between October 2017 and May 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were  assigned at random to receive oral azithromycin (2 g) or placebo (ratio 1:1)  during labor. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of  neonatal sepsis or mortality, with the former defined based on microbiologic or  clinical criteria. Secondary outcomes were neonatal infections (skin, umbilical,  eye and ear infections), malaria, and fever; postpartum infections (puerperal  sepsis, mastitis), fever, and malaria; and use of antibiotics during 4-week  follow-up. RESULTS: The trial randomized 11\,983 persons in labor (median age,  29.9 years). Overall, 225 newborns (1.9\% of 11\,783 live births) met the primary  end point. The incidence of neonatal mortality or sepsis was similar in the  azithromycin and placebo groups (2.0\% [115/5889] vs 1.9\% [110/5894]; risk  difference [RD], 0.09 [95\% CI, -0.39 to 0.57]), as was the incidence of neonatal  mortality (0.8\% vs 0.8\%; RD, 0.04 [95\% CI, -0.27 to 0.35]) and neonatal sepsis  (1.3\% vs 1.3\%; RD, 0.02 [95\% CI, -0.38 to 0.43]). Newborns in the azithromycin  group compared with the placebo group had lower incidence of skin infections  (0.8\% vs 1.7\%; RD, -0.90 [95\% CI, -1.30 to -0.49]) and need for antibiotics (6.2\%  vs 7.8\%; RD, -1.58 [95\% CI, -2.49 to -0.67]). Postpartum parents in the  azithromycin group had lower incidence of mastitis (0.3\% vs 0.5\%; RD, -0.24 [95\%  CI, -0.47 to -0.01]) and puerperal fever (0.1\% vs 0.3\%; RD, -0.19 [95\% CI, -0.36  to -0.01]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Azithromycin administered orally during  labor did not reduce neonatal sepsis or mortality. These results do not support  routine introduction of oral intrapartum azithromycin for this purpose. TRIAL  REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03199547.},

As deficits (symptoms, signs, illnesses, disabilities) accumulate, people become more susceptible to adverse health outcomes, including worse health and even death. This state of increased risk of adverse health outcomes is indistinguishable from the idea of frailty, so deficit accumulation represents another way to define frailty. Counting deficits not only allows grades of frailty to be discerned but also provides insights into the complex problems of older adults. This process is potentially useful to geriatricians who need to be experts in managing complexity. A key to managing complexity is through instruments such as a comprehensive geriatric assessment, which can serve as the basis for routine clinical estimation of an individual's degree of frailty. Understanding people and their needs as deficits accumulate is an exciting challenge for clinical research on frailty and its management by geriatricians. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

METHODS: Participants aged {$>$}/=65 years from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) representative of the Irish community-dwelling older population were analysed (n = 3507). The frailty index was used to examine patterns of utilisation across medical and social care services. Multivariate logistic and negative binomial regression models were employed to examine the impact of frailty on service utilisation outcomes after controlling for other factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty was 24\% (95\% CI: 23, 26\%) and 45\% (95\% CI: 43, 47\%) respectively. Frailty was a significant predictor of utilisation of most social care and medical care services after controlling for the main correlates of frailty and observed individual effects. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty predicts utilisation of many different types of healthcare services rendering it a useful risk stratification tool for targeting strategies of integrated care. The pattern of care is predominantly medical as few of the frail older population use social care prompting questions about sub-groups of the frail older population with unmet care needs.},

The challenge of managing medicines effectively in frail elderly patients is considerable. Our research investigates what can go wrong and why, and seeks insight into the context that might set the scene for system failure. SETTING: North London; a district general hospital and surrounding health authorities. PARTICIPANTS: 7 patients who had been admitted to hospital and 16 informants involved in their care. DESIGN: Patients with preventable medication-related admissions were identified in an occurrence screening study. An accident investigation approach was used to create case studies from accounts of staff involved in each patient's care prior to their admission. Structured analysis of case studies according to the accident investigation approach was complemented by a separate analysis of interviews using open coding with constant comparison to identify and illustrate higher-level contextual themes. OUTCOMES: The study sheds light on care management problems, their causes and the context in which care management problems and their causes have occurred. RESULTS: Care management problems were rooted in issues with decision-making, information support and communications among staff members and between staff, patients and carers. Poor judgement, slips and deviations from best practice were attributed to task overload and complexity. Within general practice, at the interface with community services and with hospitals, we identified disruption to traditional intraprofessional and interprofessional roles, assumptions, channels and media of communication which together created conditions that might compromise patient safety. CONCLUSIONS: New ways of working driven by the ethos of productivity are disrupting traditional intraprofessional and interprofessional roles, assumptions, channels and media of communication. Concomitant improvements in communications technology, process and protocol are urgently required to offset potentially serious risks to patient safety.}

DESIGN: A three-round Delphi process for validating the clinical relevance of suggested criteria (n = 37) for inappropriate prescriptions to elderly patients. SETTING: A postal consensus process undertaken by a panel of specialists in general practice, clinical pharmacology, and geriatrics. Main outcome measures. The Norwegian General Practice (NORGEP) criteria, a relevance-validated list of drugs, drug dosages, and drug combinations to be avoided in the elderly ({$<$} or =70 years) patients. RESULTS: Of the 140 invited panellists, 57 accepted to participate and 47 completed all three rounds of the Delphi process. The panellists reached consensus that 36 of the 37 suggested criteria were clinically relevant for general practice. Relevance of three of the criteria was rated significantly higher in Round 3 than in Round 1. At the end of the Delphi process, a significant difference between the different specialist groups' scores was seen for only one of the 36 criteria. CONCLUSION: The NORGEP criteria may serve as rules of thumb for general practitioners (GPs) related to their prescribing practice for elderly patients, and as a tool for evaluating the quality of GPs' prescribing in settings where access to clinical information for individual patients is limited, e.g. in prescription databases and quality improvement interventions.},

Paradoxically, vitamin D insufficiency is rarely treated despite of strong clinical evidence and recommendations for supplementation. This review aims at reporting the current knowledge of vitamin D supplementation in NH and proposing recommendations adapted to the specificities of this institutional setting. DESIGN: Current literature on vitamin D supplementation for NH residents was narratively presented and discussed by the French Group of Geriatrics and Nutrition. RESULT: Vitamin D supplementation is a safe and well-tolerated treatment. Most residents in NH have vitamin D insufficiency, and would benefit from vitamin D supplement. However, only few residents are actually treated. Current specific and personalized protocols for vitamin D supplementation may not be practical for use in NH settings (e.g., assessment of serum vitamin D concentrations before and after supplementation). Therefore, our group proposes a model of intervention based on the systematic supplementation of vitamin D (1,000 IU/day) since the patient's admission to the NH and throughout his/her stay without the need of a preliminary evaluation of the baseline levels. Calcium should be prescribed only in case of poor dietary calcium intake. CONCLUSION: A population-based rather than individual-based approach may probably improve the management of vitamin D insufficiency in the older population living in NH, without increasing the risks of adverse health problems. The clinical relevance and cost effectiveness of this proposal should be assessed under NH real-world conditions to establish its feasibility.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The adoption of a frailty paradigm in primary care would be helpful to identify adults who need priority access to specialised resources. The frailty phenotype by Fried et al is a popular operationalisation of frailty, but it is not easily applicable in routine primary care practice. We recently created and validated a frailty instrument based on the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE-FI), in order to provide primary care practitioners with an easy, reliable and freely accessible tool for the assessment and monitoring of frailty in community dwelling adults over the age of 50 years (www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2318/10/57). AIM: To provide further prospective validation of SHARE-FI, with a focus on disability. DESIGN: longitudinal study (wave 1: 2004-2006; mean follow-up: 2.4 years). SETTING: European population-based survey (12 countries). SUBJECTS: 17 567 community dwelling participants (mean age 63.3 years), of whom 13 378 (76.2\%) were non-frail, 3438 (19.6\%) pre-frail and 751 (4.3\%) frail. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: number of difficulties with basic (ADL) and instrumental (IADL) activities of daily living. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: repeated measures ANOVA with adjustment for baseline age. RESULTS: By wave 2, 3.6\% of the non-frail, 12.2\% of the pre-frail and 30.4\% of the frail had increased their number of ADL difficulties by at least one. Likewise, 6.6\% of the non-frail, 20.4\% of the prefrail and 36.6\% of the frail had, by wave 2, increased their number of IADL difficulties by at least one. Table 1 shows the repeated measures ANOVA suggested. CONCLUSION: SHARE-FI may contribute to quality in primary care by offering a quick and reliable way to assess and monitor frailty in community dwelling individuals over the age of 50 and prioritize their access to resources, and it serves as a novel tool for audit and research.},

This multicountry survey aimed to elucidate current practices,  challenges and case definitions in managing NS among clinicians in Sub-Saharan  Africa. METHODS: The survey targeted physicians and medical practitioners working  in neonatal care who participated in a Self-Administered Web Questionnaire. The  main objective was to understand NS and infection case definitions and management  from the clinician's point of view and to identify challenges and opportunities  in sepsis management. Participants were queried on demographics, definitions and  diagnostic criteria, treatment approaches, and infection prevention and control  (IPC) measures. A total of 136 participants from 93 healthcare structures  responded, providing valuable insights into NS management practices. RESULTS:  From May to July 2022 across 21 Sub-Saharan African countries, 136 neonatal  clinicians with an average from 93 structures with on average 10-year experience  took the survey. NS ranked highest among prevalent neonatal conditions.  Diagnostic case definitions between sepsis and infection were attributed to  clinical signs, anamnesis, C reactive protein, white blood cll count and blood  cultures with no statistically significant differences. Early-onset sepsis was  defined within 72 hours by 48\%, while late-onset varied. Antibiotics were likely  on admission (86.4\%) and during the stay (82.2\%). Treatment abandonment was  reported unlikely. The preferred antibiotic regimen for early-onset sepsis was  intravenous amoxicillin (or ampicillin), gentamycin and cefotaxime. Blood culture  availability and IPC protocols were reported as limited, particularly concerning  patient environment, pharmacy protocols and clean-dirty circuits. CONCLUSIONS:  This NS survey emphasises clinicians' challenges due to limited access to  diagnostic tools and raises concerns about antimicrobial overexposure. IPC also  seem limited, according to participants. Addressing these challenges can enhance  diagnostic practices, antibiotic stewardship and infection control in the region.},

  abstract = {The aims of this randomised controlled trial were to determine if a high-intensity functional exercise program improves balance, gait ability, and lower-limb strength in older persons dependent in activities of daily living and if an intake of protein-enriched energy supplement immediately after the exercises increases the effects of the training. One hundred and ninety-one older persons dependent in activities of daily living, living in residential care facilities, and with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of ? 10 participated. They were randomised to a high-intensity functional exercise program or a control activity, which included 29 sessions over 3 months, as well as to protein-enriched energy supplement or placebo. Berg Balance Scale, self-paced and maximum gait speed, and one-repetition maximum in lower-limb strength were followed-up at three and six months and analysed by 2 x 2 factorial ANCOVA, using the intention-to-treat principle. At three months, the exercise group had improved significantly in self-paced gait speed compared with the control group (mean difference 0.04 m/s, p = 0.02). At six months, there were significant improvements favouring the exercise group for Berg Balance Scale (1.9 points, p = 0.05), self-paced gait speed (0.05 m/s, p = 0.009), and lower-limb strength (10.8 kg, p = 0.03). No interaction effects were seen between the exercise and nutrition interventions. In conclusion, a high-intensity functional exercise program has positive long-term effects in balance, gait ability, and lower-limb strength for older persons dependent in activities of daily living. An intake of protein-enriched energy supplement immediately after the exercises does not appear to increase the effects of the training.},

PURPOSE: To describe content and concurrent validity, test-retest reliability and internal consistency of the Swedish version of the Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) in patients with surgically treated CMC joint OA. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients were assessed ten weeks after surgical treatment of CMC joint OA. PSFS, the shorter version of Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (Quick DASH), EuroQol-5Dimensions (EQ-5D), pain intensity, joint movement of CMC joint, grip and pinch strength were assessed. Classification of activities was done according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Spearman correlation, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and Kappa were calculated to assess validity, test-retest reliability and internal consistency. The PSFS was administered twice, 2-3 days apart. RESULTS: All of the activity limitations stated in the PSFS could be classified according to the activity component in the ICF. Significant correlations for the PSFS were obtained with pain at rest (r(s)~=~-0.36) and the Quick DASH (r(s)~=~-0.28). Test-retest reliability was good, ICC (0.79) and the three items of the PSFS correlated 0.69-0.83 with the total score of PSFS. CONCLUSION: Content validity was excellent, concurrent validity was low-moderate, as in earlier studies. The PSFS could be a valuable supplement to existing measures in measuring activity limitations in individuals with surgically treated CMC joint OA. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Not applicable.},

We then identified patient characteristics associated with family support and family barriers and how each was associated with self-management adherence. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 439 patients with diabetes or heart failure (74\% response rate). RESULTS: 75\% of respondents reported supportive family involvement in self-care; however, 25\% reported frequent family-related barriers to self-care. Women reported family support less often (64\% v. 77\%) and family barriers to self-care more often (30\% v. 21\%) than men. 78\% of respondents reported involved family members nagged or criticized them about illness care. In multivariate models, low health literacy, partnered status and higher family function were associated with higher family support levels, while female gender, older age, higher education, and more depression symptoms were associated with family barriers to self-care. Family barriers were associated with lower disease care self-efficacy (p{$<$}0.01), and both barriers and family support were associated with patients' self-management adherence (both p{$<$}0.05). DISCUSSION: Family members are highly involved in the self-care of these higher functioning patients. Interventions should help patients with chronic illness overcome family barriers to self-care and help families use positive and effective support techniques.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Professional and patient groups have called for increased participation of patients' informal support networks in chronic disease care, as a means to improve clinical care and self-management. Little is known about the current level of participation of family and friends in the physician visits of adults with chronic illnesses or how that participation affects the experience of patients and physicians. METHODS: Written survey of 439 functionally independent adults with diabetes or heart failure and 88 of their primary care physicians (PCPs). Patients were ineligible if they had a memory disorder, needed help with activities of daily living, or were undergoing cancer treatment. RESULTS: Nonprofessional friends or family ("companions") regularly participated in PCP visits for nearly half (48\%) of patients. In multivariable models, patients with low health literacy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.9, confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-5.7), more depressive symptoms (AOR: 1.3, CI: 1.1-1.6), and 4 or more comorbid illnesses (AOR: 3.7, CI: 1.3-10.5) were more likely to report companion participation. Patients reported that they were more likely to understand PCP advice (77\%) and discuss difficult topics with the physician (44\%) when companions participated in clinic visits. In multivariable models, companion participation was associated with greater patient satisfaction with their PCP (AOR: 1.7, CI: 1.1-2.7). Most PCPs perceived visit companions positively, however 66\% perceived 1 or more barriers to increasing companion participation, including increased physician burden (39\%), inadequate physician training (27\%), and patient privacy concerns (24\%). CONCLUSION: Patients' companions represent an important source of potential support for the clinical care of functionally independent patients with diabetes or heart failure, particularly for patients vulnerable to worse outcomes. Companion participation in care was associated with positive patient and physician experiences. Physician concerns about companion participation are potentially addressable through existing training resources.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The concept of type 2 diabetes remission is evolving rapidly, and gaining wide public and professional interest, following demonstration that with substantial intentional weight loss almost nine in ten people with type 2 diabetes can reduce their HbA               1c               level below the diagnostic criterion (48 mmol/mol [6.5\%]) without glucose-lowering medications, and improve all features of the metabolic syndrome. Pursuing nomoglycaemia with older drugs was dangerous because of the risk of side effects and hypoglycaemia, so the conventional treatment target was an HbA               1c               concentration of 53 mmol/mol (7\%), meaning that diabetes was still present and allowing disease progression. Newer agents may achieve a normal HbA               1c               safely and, by analogy with treatments that send cancers or inflammatory diseases into remission, this might also be considered remission. However, although modern glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and related medications are highly effective for weight loss and glycaemic improvement, and generally safe, many people do not want to take drugs indefinitely, and their cost means that they are not available across much of the world. Therefore, there are strong reasons to explore and research dietary approaches for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. All interventions that achieve sustained weight loss of {$>$}10--15 kg improve HbA               1c               , potentially resulting in remission if sufficient beta cell capacity can be preserved or restored, which occurs with loss of the ectopic fat in liver and pancreas that is found with type 2 diabetes. Remission is most likely with type 2 diabetes of short duration, lower HbA               1c               and a low requirement for glucose-lowering medications. Relapse is likely with weight regain and among those with a poor beta cell reserve. On current evidence, effective weight management should be provided to all people with type 2 diabetes as soon as possible after diagnosis (or even earlier, at the stage of prediabetes, defined in Europe, Australasia, Canada [and most of the world] as {$\geq$}42 and {$<$}48 mmol/mol [{$\geq$}6.0 and {$<$}6.5\%], and in the USA as HbA1c {$\geq$}39 and {$<$}48 mmol/mol [{$\geq$}5.7 and {$<$}6.5\%]). Raising awareness among people with type 2 diabetes and their healthcare providers that remission is possible will enable earlier intervention. Weight loss of {$>$}10 kg and remission lasting 1--2 years may also delay vascular complications, although more evidence is needed. The greatest challenge for research is to improve long-term weight loss maintenance, defining cost-effective approaches tailored to the preferences and needs of people living with type 2 diabetes.

Participants were 217 patients aged 18 years or older with type 2 diabetes and poor glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] levels {$\geq$}8.0\%) and presenting to a US academic general internal medicine practice.InterventionsAll communication to patients was individualized and delivered to enhance comprehension among patients with low literacy. Intervention patients received intensive disease management from a multidisciplinary team. Control patients received an initial management session and continued with usual care.Main Outcome MeasuresAchievement of goal HbA1c levels and systolic blood pressure at 12-month follow-up for control and intervention patients stratified by literacy status.ResultsComplete 12-month data were available for 193 patients (89\%). Among patients with low literacy, intervention patients were more likely than control patients to achieve goal HbA1c levels ({$\leq$}7.0\%) (42\% vs 15\%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 4.6; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 17.2; P~=~.02). Patients with higher literacy had similar odds of achieving goal HbA1c levels regardless of intervention status (24\% vs 23\%; adjusted OR, 1.0; 95\% CI, 0.4 to 2.5; P~=~.98). Improvements in systolic blood pressure were similar by literacy status.ConclusionsLiteracy may be an important factor for predicting who will benefit from an intervention for diabetes management. A diabetes disease management program that addresses literacy may be particularly beneficial for patients with low literacy, and increasing access to such a program could help reduce health disparities.}

Despite broad interest in readmission, relatively little research has focused on patients with diabetes. The burden of diabetes among hospitalized patients, however, is substantial, growing, and costly, and readmissions contribute a significant portion of this burden. Reducing readmission rates of diabetic patients has the potential to greatly reduce health care costs while simultaneously improving care. Risk factors for readmission in this population include lower socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic minority, comorbidity burden, public insurance, emergent or urgent admission, and a history of recent prior hospitalization. Hospitalized patients with diabetes may be at higher risk of readmission than those without diabetes. Potential ways to reduce readmission risk are inpatient education, specialty care, better discharge instructions, coordination of care, and post-discharge support. More studies are needed to test the effect of these interventions on the readmission rates of patients with diabetes.},

  abstract = {Diabetes mellitus imposes a significant financial burden on Wisconsin's health care system. One portion of this burden is attributable to the cost of hospitalizing diabetes patients. During 1996 hospital inpatients with a principal diagnosis of diabetes generated over \$60 million in hospital charges (physician fees excluded). Ambulatory surgery patients generated an additional \$3.4 million in facility charges. This article examines those costs, according to age and gender, expected pay source, and by county. It also reports the reasons for hospitalization and ambulatory surgery for patients whose principal diagnosis was diabetes. Employers, public health professionals, physicians and managed care firms are interested in containing the social and personal costs of diabetes mellitus. This paper explores the financial burden associated with hospitalization and ambulatory surgeries for diabetes in Wisconsin for 1996.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Up to 70 \% of dialysis patients over 55 years suffer from some degree of dementia. For a patient with dementia eventually agitated, staying at rest during the whole haemodialysis session could be difficult, which represents a real challenge for the haemodialysis team. Although relatives of patients with dementia or haemodialysis patients were described as care experts because of their support in everyday life, the perspective of relatives of haemodialysis patients with dementia has not yet been researched. AIM: The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the experience of nursing care of relatives of haemodialysis patients with dementia in a haemodialysis unit. METHODS: Data were collected through eight interviews with relatives. Content analysis was used to analyse data. RESULTS: Relatives knew that the patients were in good hands with their nurses. Their own attendance of the dialysis sessions was of variable duration, frequency and regularity, and they were hardly involved in the care. Relatives and nurses rarely communicated regarding the patients' situation. Although relatives described symptoms of dementia, it was important for them to attest that the patients were still "mentally all right". CONCLUSIONS: Relatives of patients with dementia have diverse needs concerning their attendance during the therapy and the exchange of information with clinicians. Nurses should approach relatives and assess their individual needs to achieve a better collaboration.},

Data was gathered on sociodemographic characteristics, health, quality of life, social support and perceived stress.Results:Frequency of and satisfaction with different sources and types of support are related positively with improvement of quality of life and negatively with perceived stress. The emotional support from the partner and the emotional and informational support from the family are significant predictors of quality of life. Emotional support from the family reduces patients? perceived stress. Satisfaction with emotional support from the partner and with the informational support from friends and family increases quality of life. Satisfaction with emotional support from the family and with informational support from friends decreases patients? perceived stress. Instrumental support and support provided by health professionals are not good predictors of quality of life and perceived stress. Satisfaction with the support received is more significantly related with quality of life and stress than the frequency with which the sources provide support.Conclusions:These results have important practical implications to improve cancer patients? quality of life and reduce their perceived stress through social support. Designing intervention strategies to improve satisfaction with the support provided to patients by their closest networks results in a global benefit for the patient?s quality of life.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A maternal group B streptococcal (GBS) vaccine could prevent neonatal sepsis and meningitis. Its cost-effectiveness in low-income sub-Saharan Africa, a  high burden region, is unknown. METHODS: We used a decision tree model, with  Markov nodes to project infants' lifetimes, to compare maternal immunization  delivered through routine antenatal care with no immunization. 37 countries were  clustered on the basis of economic and health resources and past public health  performance. Vaccine efficacy for covered serotypes was ranged from 50\% to 90\%.  The model projected EOGBS (early-onset) and LOGBS (late-onset) cases and deaths,  disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), healthcare costs (2014 US\$), and  cost-effectiveness for a representative country in each of the four clusters:  Guinea-Bissau, Uganda, Nigeria, and Ghana. Maximum vaccination costs/dose were  estimated to meet two cost-effectiveness benchmarks, 0.5 GDP and GDP per  capita/DALY, for ranges of disease incidence (reported and adjusted for  under-reporting) and vaccine efficacy. RESULTS: At coverage equal to the  proportion of pregnant women with{$\geq$}4 antenatal visits (ANC4) and serotype-specific  vaccine efficacy of 70\%, maternal GBS immunization would prevent one-third of GBS  cases and deaths in Uganda and Nigeria, where ANC4 is 50\%, 42-43\% in  Guinea-Bissau (ANC4=65\%), and 55-57\% in Ghana (ANC4=87\%). At a vaccination cost  of \$7/dose, maternal immunization would cost \$320-\$350/DALY averted in  Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria, and Ghana, less than half these countries' GDP per  capita. In Uganda, which has the lowest case fatality ratios, the cost would be  \$573/DALY. If the vaccine prevents a small proportion of stillbirths, it would be  even more cost-effective. Vaccination cost/dose, disease incidence, and case  fatality were key drivers of cost/DALY in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION:  Maternal GBS immunization could be a cost-effective intervention in low-income  sub-Saharan Africa, with cost-effectiveness ratios similar to other recently  introduced vaccines. The vaccination cost at which introduction is cost-effective  depends on disease incidence and vaccine efficacy. Clinical Trial registry name  and registration number: Not applicable.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is limited data on antibiotic treatment in hospitalized neonates in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed to describe  patterns of antibiotic use, pathogens, and clinical outcomes, and to develop a  severity score predicting mortality in neonatal sepsis to inform future clinical  trial design. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Hospitalized infants {$<$}60 days with clinical  sepsis were enrolled during 2018 to 2020 by 19 sites in 11 countries (mainly Asia  and Africa). Prospective daily observational data was collected on clinical  signs, supportive care, antibiotic treatment, microbiology, and 28-day mortality.  Two prediction models were developed for (1) 28-day mortality from baseline  variables (baseline NeoSep Severity Score); and (2) daily risk of death on IV  antibiotics from daily updated assessments (NeoSep Recovery Score). Multivariable  Cox regression models included a randomly selected 85\% of infants, with 15\% for  validation. A total of 3,204 infants were enrolled, with median birth weight of  2,500 g (IQR 1,400 to 3,000) and postnatal age of 5 days (IQR 1 to 15). 206  different empiric antibiotic combinations were started in 3,141 infants, which  were structured into 5 groups based on the World Health Organization (WHO) AWaRe  classification. Approximately 25.9\% (n = 814) of infants started WHO first line  regimens (Group 1-Access) and 13.8\% (n = 432) started WHO second-line  cephalosporins (cefotaxime/ceftriaxone) (Group 2-"Low" Watch). The largest group  (34.0\%, n = 1,068) started a regimen providing partial extended-spectrum  beta-lactamase (ESBL)/pseudomonal coverage (piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime,  or fluoroquinolone-based) (Group 3-"Medium" Watch), 18.0\% (n = 566) started a  carbapenem (Group 4-"High" Watch), and 1.8\% (n = 57) a Reserve antibiotic (Group  5, largely colistin-based), and 728/2,880 (25.3\%) of initial regimens in Groups 1  to 4 were escalated, mainly to carbapenems, usually for clinical deterioration (n  = 480; 65.9\%). A total of 564/3,195 infants (17.7\%) were blood culture pathogen  positive, of whom 62.9\% (n = 355) had a gram-negative organism, predominantly  Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 132) or Acinetobacter spp. (n = 72). Both were  commonly resistant to WHO-recommended regimens and to carbapenems in 43 (32.6\%)  and 50 (71.4\%) of cases, respectively. MRSA accounted for 33 (61.1\%) of 54  Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Overall, 350/3,204 infants died (11.3\%; 95\% CI  10.2\% to 12.5\%), 17.7\% if blood cultures were positive for pathogens (95\% CI  14.7\% to 21.1\%, n = 99/564). A baseline NeoSep Severity Score had a C-index of  0.76 (0.69 to 0.82) in the validation sample, with mortality of 1.6\% (3/189; 95\%  CI: 0.5\% to 4.6\%), 11.0\% (27/245; 7.7\% to 15.6\%), and 27.3\% (12/44; 16.3\% to  41.8\%) in low (score 0 to 4), medium (5 to 8), and high (9 to 16) risk groups,  respectively, with similar performance across subgroups. A related NeoSep  Recovery Score had an area under the receiver operating curve for predicting  death the next day between 0.8 and 0.9 over the first week. There was significant  variation in outcomes between sites and external validation would strengthen  score applicability. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic regimens used in neonatal sepsis  commonly diverge from WHO guidelines, and trials of novel empiric regimens are  urgently needed in the context of increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The  baseline NeoSep Severity Score identifies high mortality risk criteria for trial  entry, while the NeoSep Recovery Score can help guide decisions on regimen  change. NeoOBS data informed the NeoSep1 antibiotic trial (ISRCTN48721236), which  aims to identify novel first- and second-line empiric antibiotic regimens for  neonatal sepsis.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is traditionally classified as early-onset sepsis (EOS) and late-onset sepsis (LOS) disease categories. This paradigm was based on  observed epidemiological data from high income settings. However, increasing  availability of microbiology results from diverse settings challenges these  assumptions, necessitating re-examination of neonatal sepsis classifications.  OBJECTIVES: To review the literature describing the aetiology of EOS and LOS in  hospitalized neonates with stratification of pathogen spectrum by low- (LIC),  middle- (MIC) and high-income (HIC) country settings, to critically re-examine  the continued appropriateness of the 'EOS vs. LOS' sepsis paradigm in all  settings. SOURCES: PubMed was searched for peer-reviewed English full-text  articles published from inception up until 8 August 2022. CONTENT: Studies often  report on either EOS or LOS, rather than both. We identified only 49 original  articles reporting on pathogen distribution of both EOS and LOS in the same  hospital setting. Clear differences in sepsis aetiology were shown between LIC,  MIC and HIC settings, with increasing importance of Klebsiella pneumoniae and  decreasing importance of Group B Streptococcus in the first 72~hours of life in  LIC and MIC. IMPLICATIONS: The concept of 'EOS vs. LOS' may be less useful for  predicting the pathogen spectrum of neonatal sepsis in LIC and MIC, but the  paradigm has shaped reporting of neonatal sepsis, and our understanding. Future  neonatal sepsis reporting should utilize strengthening the reporting of  observational studies in epidemiology for newborn infection (STROBE-NI) reporting  guidelines and clearly describe timing of infection by day, and variation in  pathogen spectrum across the neonatal period. Data identified in this review  challenge the generalizability of the prevailing EOS/LOS paradigm in LIC and MIC.},

The aim of the present study was to describe the impact of a physical and nutritional intervention program for frail community- dwelling elderly people over the age of 75. METHODS: Ninety-six community-dwelling elderly people (58 women) were randomized to four different groups: i) a physical training program (aerobic, muscle strength, balance), ii) a nutritional intervention program (individually targeted advice and group sessions), iii) a combination of these interventions, and iv) a control group. At baseline subjects were screened for physical performance such as muscle strength, balance, mobility and activities of daily living, as well as nutritional aspects such as energy intake, body weight and fat-free mass. These measurements were repeated immediately after the intervention, which lasted for 12 weeks, and after another 6 months. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat analysis indicated significant improvements in lower- extremity muscle strength in both training groups compared with the nutrition group at 1st follow-up. There were small significant changes for some of the balance measurements in the training group without nutrition treatment. The nutrition intervention did not show any significant results. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the positive effect on lower-extremity muscle strength directly after the intervention. Balance training most probably needs to be more individualized in order to be effective for frail elderly people. Further studies are needed, with larger sample sizes, to investigate the effects of these types of interventions before any further conclusions can be drawn.},

No studies have investigated the effect of physical training alone or in combination with nutritional intervention on aerobic capacity in frail elderly people. The aim of this pilot study was to determine if a physical training program can affect aerobic capacity in frail elderly people. METHODS: Ninety-six community-dwelling frail elderly people (58 women) were included in the study. Subjects were randomized to four different groups: i) physical training program (aerobic, muscle strength, balance), ii) a nutritional intervention program (individually targeted advice and group sessions), iii) a combination of these interventions, and iv) a control group. At baseline, subjects were screened for aerobic capacity, leg muscle strength, spirometry, heart disease and cardiovascular drugs. Aerobic capacity and leg muscle strength were analyzed immediately after the 3-month intervention period (1st follow-up), and after another 6 months (2nd follow-up). RESULTS: Subjects mean age was 83 years. The mean compliance rate with the physical training program was 65\%. There were no observed effects on aerobic capacity measured as maximal workload, or work time, with or without beta-receptor blockade. Subjects in the training groups without lung disease significantly increased maximal work time when compared with subjects with lung disease. Physical training significantly increased lower extremity muscle strength compared with nutrition alone at the 1st follow-up. No serious adverse events occurred during assessment or physical training. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies with larger sample sizes and a more specific aerobic component in the training program are necessary before any further conclusions can be drawn.},

The aim of this meta-narrative systematic review was to critically appraise evidence from qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies that explored men's information-seeking behaviors in relation to cancer prevention and risk reduction. METHODS: MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Education Full Text, and ERIC were systematically searched for studies published in English between January 1, 2006 and May 30, 2016. A total of 4117 titles were identified; of which, 31 studies were included (21 qualitative studies, 9 quantitative studies, and 1 mixed-methods study). The methodological quality of the studies was appraised by using different tools. RESULTS: Most studies focused on screening for prostate (n~=~18) and colorectal cancer (n~=~7). Most men were passive information-gatherers rather than active information-seekers. Key sources of information included the Internet for active information-seekers and health care professionals for passive information-gatherers. Barriers to information-seeking included information overload, embarrassment, and fear. Low literacy and health literacy levels were addressed in 3 studies and were identified as impediments to active information-seeking. Facilitators to information-seeking included family support, media, celebrity endorsements, and targeted information. CONCLUSIONS: Men's information-seeking behavior regarding cancer risk reduction, prevention, and screening is influenced by several factors. This necessitates targeted interventions aimed at raising awareness of cancer prevention and screening, while accounting for men's informational needs, preferred learning strategies, and literacy levels.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Communication has been researched either as a set of behaviors or as a facet of the patient-physician relationship, often leading to conflicting results. To determine the relationship between these perspectives, we examined shared decision making (SDM) and the subjective experience of partnership for patients and physicians in primary care. METHODS: From a convenience sample of experienced primary care physicians in 3 clinics, we recruited a stratified sample of 18 English- or Spanish-speaking patients. Direct observation of visits was followed by videotape-triggered stimulated recall sessions with patients and physicians. We coded decision moments for objective evidence of SDM, using a structured instrument. We classified patients' and physicians' subjective experience of partnership as positive or negative by a consensus analysis of stimulated recall sessions. We combined results from these 2 analyses to generate 4 archetypes of engagements and used grounded theory to identify themes associated with each archetype. RESULTS: The 18 visits yielded 125 decisions, 62 (50\%) of which demonstrated SDM. Eighty-two decisions were discussed in stimulated recall and available for combined analysis, resulting in 4 archetypes of engagement in decision making: full engagement (SDM present, subjective experience positive)--22\%; simulated engagement (SDM present, subjective experience negative)--38\%; assumed engagement (SDM absent, subjective experience positive)--21\%; and nonengagement (SDM absent, subjective experience negative)--19\%. Thematic analysis revealed that both relationship factors (eg, trust, power) and communication behavior influenced subjective experience of partnership. CONCLUSIONS: Combining direct observation and assessment of the subjective experience of partnership suggests that communication behavior does not ensure an experience of collaboration, and a positive subjective experience of partnership does not reflect full communication. Attempts to enhance patient-physician partnership must attend to both effective communication style and affective relationship dynamics.},

Pulmonary rehabilitation, including self-management education, highlights the importance of good patient-provider communication in establishing optimal care. There is a growing awareness of the potential impact of health literacy (HL) on the patients' access to and understanding of medical information. This study was designed to explore the patients' and health care professionals' (HCPs) perceptions of the role of HL in health communication. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with 12 patients and 20 HCPs at a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Center in Metropolitan Toronto. Although the term health literacy was not familiar to many patients, the contribution of knowledge to patient well-being was consistently identified by patients and HCPs. Barriers to communication included provider time constraints and the use of medical jargon. For providers they also included patient characteristics, language, culture and awareness of health resources. Approaches that might improve communication incorporated family support, peer support, better print and visual teaching material and a trusting empathic patient-provider relationship. The findings provide an increased understanding of patients' and providers' perceptions of HL as a barrier to effective communication of medical information to patients with COPD as well as approaches that might improve this communication.},

Methods: A total of 255 high-quality data sources, published between 1990 and 2018 and representing 138 countries were identified. For countries without high quality in-country data, estimates were extrapolated from similar countries matched by economy, ethnicity, geography and language. Logistic regression was used to generate smoothed age-specific diabetes prevalence estimates (including previously undiagnosed diabetes) in adults aged 20--79 years. Results: The global diabetes prevalence in 2019 is estimated to be 9.3\% (463 million people), rising to 10.2\% (578 million) by 2030 and 10.9\% (700 million) by 2045. The prevalence is higher in urban (10.8\%) than rural (7.2\%) areas, and in high-income (10.4\%) than lowincome countries (4.0\%). One in two (50.1\%) people living with diabetes do not know that they have diabetes. The global prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance is estimated to be 7.5\% (374 million) in 2019 and projected to reach 8.0\% (454 million) by 2030 and 8.6\% (548 million) by 2045. Conclusions: Just under half a billion people are living with diabetes worldwide and the number is projected to increase by 25\% in 2030 and 51\% in 2045.},

  abstract = {Objective To identify factors that influence general practitioners' (GPs') oral antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract complaints (aRTCs) in Malta.Design Repeated, cross-sectional surveillance.Setting Maltese general practice; both public health centres and private GP clinics.Participants 30 GPs registered on the Malta Medical Council's Specialist Register and 3 GP trainees registered data of 4831 patients of all ages suffering from any aRTC. Data were collected monthly between May 2015 and April 2016 during predetermined 1-week periods.Outcome measures The outcome of interest was antibiotic prescription (yes/no), defined as an oral antibiotic prescription issued for an aRTC during an in-person consultation, irrespective of the number of antibiotics given. The association between GP, practice and consultation-level factors, patient sociodemographic factors and patient health status factors, and antibiotic prescription was investigated.Results The antibiotic prescription rate was 45.0\%. Independent factors positively associated with antibiotic prescribing included female GP sex (OR 2.3, 95\%\,CI 1.22 to 4.26), GP age with GPs {$\geq$}60 being the most likely (OR 34.7, 95\%\,CI 14.14 to 84.98), patient age with patients {$\geq$}65 being the most likely (OR 2.3, 95\%\,CI 1.71 to 3.18), number of signs and/or symptoms with patients having {$\geq$}4 being the most likely (OR 9.6, 95\%\,CI 5.78 to 15.99), fever (OR 2.6, 95\%\,CI 2.08 to 3.26), productive cough (OR 1.3, 95\%\,CI 1.03 to 1.61), otalgia (OR 1.3, 95\%\,CI 1.01 to 1.76), tender cervical nodes (OR 2.2, 95\%\,CI 1.57 to 3.05), regular clients (OR 1.3, 95\%\,CI 1.05 to 1.66), antibiotic requests (OR 4.8, 95\%\,CI 2.52 to 8.99) and smoking (OR 1.4, 95\%\,CI 1.13 to 1.71). Conversely, patients with non-productive cough (OR 0.3, 95\%\,CI 0.26 to 0.41), sore throat (OR 0.6, 95\%\,CI 0.53 to 0.78), rhinorrhoea (OR 0.3, 95\%\,CI 0.23 to 0.36) or dyspnoea (OR 0.6, 95\%\,CI 0.41 to 0.83) were less likely to receive an antibiotic prescription.Conclusion Antibiotic prescribing for aRTCs was high and influenced by a number of factors. Potentially inappropriate prescribing in primary care can be addressed through multifaceted interventions addressing modifiable factors associated with prescription.Trial registration number NCT03218930},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Supported asthma self-management improves health outcomes. However, people with limited health literacy, especially in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs), may need tailored interventions to enable them to realise the benefits. We aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness of asthma self-management interventions targeted at people with limited health literacy and to identify strategies associated with effective programmes. METHODS: Following Cochrane methodology, we searched ten databases (January 1990 - June 2018; updated October 2019), without language restriction. We included controlled experimental studies whose interventions targeted health literacy to improve asthma self-management. Selection of papers, extraction of data and quality assessment were done independently by two reviewers. The primary outcomes were clinical (asthma control) and implementation (adoption/adherence to intervention). Analysis was narrative. RESULTS: We screened 4318 titles and abstracts, reviewed 52 full-texts and included five trials. One trial was conducted in a LMIC. Risk of bias was low in one trial and high in the other four studies. Clinical outcomes were reported in two trials, both at high risk of bias: one of which reported a reduction in unscheduled care (number of visits in 6-month (SD); Intervention:0.9 (1.2) vs Control:1.8 (2.4), P\,=\,0.001); the other showed no effect. None reported uptake or adherence to the intervention. Behavioural change strategies typically focused on improving an individual's psychological and physical capacity to enact behaviour (eg, targeting asthma-related knowledge or comprehension). Only two interventions also targeted motivation; none sought to improve opportunity. Less than half of the interventions used specific self-management strategies (eg, written asthma action plan) with tailoring to limited health literacy status. Different approaches (eg, video-based and pictorial action plans) were used to provide education. CONCLUSIONS: The paucity of studies and diversity of the interventions to support people with limited health literacy to self-manage their asthma meant that the impact on health outcomes remains unclear. Given the proportion of the global population who have limited health literacy skills, this is a research priority. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD 42018118974.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Knowledge concerning antibiotic use in the general population is insufficient. The way health literacy is related to antibiotic use aside from knowledge needs further investigation. Our aim was to compare the levels of knowledge of antibiotics and health literacy in individuals who had taken antibiotics in recent years compared with those who not had taken antibiotics. METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional survey of 2,000 individuals aged 35 and older from Berlin, Germany and its surrounding rural and suburban areas (response rate 59\%) with strata urban/rural, sex, age, and education. Computer-assisted personal interviews were conducted by external, trained interviewers during home visits. Knowledge, health literacy, and antibiotic use were assessed using standardized questionnaires. RESULTS: In all, 33.3\% (666/2,000) of the participants indicated having had an antimicrobial therapy during the previous 12 months. Adjusting for sex, age, educational level and health literacy, individuals with four correct answers regarding antibiotics were 1.70 times and those with three correct answers 1.94 more likely to have had a history of recent antibiotic use than those who did not have any correct answers. Individuals with sufficient health literacy were 0.57 times less likely to have had a recent history of antibiotic use than individuals with insufficient health literacy. CONCLUSION: Patients who have used antibiotics might have more knowledge as a result of their recent involvement with the topic of antibiotic use; health literacy may be a preventive mechanism to use antibiotics more critically. Besides improving the health knowledge of the general population and of vulnerable groups such as patients with low levels of health literacy, intervention strategies should focus on providers as well.},

The Burden of Antibiotic Resistance in Neonates from  Developing Societies (BARNARDS) network was initiated to characterize the cause  and burden of antimicrobial resistance in neonatal sepsis for seven LMICs in  Africa and South Asia. A total of 36,285 neonates were enrolled in the BARNARDS  study between November 2015 and December 2017, of whom 2,483 were diagnosed with  culture-confirmed sepsis. Klebsiella pneumoniae (n\,=\,258) was the main cause of  neonatal sepsis, with Serratia marcescens (n\,=\,151), Klebsiella michiganensis  (n\,=\,117), Escherichia coli (n\,=\,75) and Enterobacter cloacae complex (n\,=\,57)  also detected. We present whole-genome sequencing, antimicrobial susceptibility  and clinical data for 916 out of 1,038 neonatal sepsis isolates (97 isolates were  not recovered from initial isolation at local sites). Enterobacterales (K.  pneumoniae, E. coli and E. cloacae) harboured multiple cephalosporin and  carbapenem resistance genes. All isolated pathogens were resistant to multiple  antibiotic classes, including those used to treat neonatal sepsis. Intraspecies  diversity of K. pneumoniae and E. coli indicated that multiple  antibiotic-resistant lineages cause neonatal sepsis. Our results will underpin  research towards better treatments for neonatal sepsis in LMICs.},

METHODS: We characterised GPB isolates from  neonatal blood cultures from LMICs in Africa (Ethiopia, Nigeria, Rwanda, and  South Africa) and South-Asia (Bangladesh and Pakistan) between 2015-2017. We  determined minimum inhibitory concentrations and performed whole genome  sequencing (WGS) on Staphylococci isolates recovered and clinical data collected  related to the onset of sepsis and the outcome of the neonate up to 60~days of  age. RESULTS: From the isolates recovered from blood cultures, Staphylococci  species were most frequently identified. Out of 100 S. aureus isolates sequenced,  18 different sequence types (ST) were found which unveiled two small  epidemiological clusters caused by methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in  Pakistan (ST8) and South Africa (ST5), both with high mortality (n\,=\,6/17).  One-third of S. aureus was MRSA, with methicillin resistance also detected in  Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Mammaliicoccus  sciuri. Through additional WGS analysis we report a cluster of M. sciuri in  Pakistan identified between July-November 2017. CONCLUSIONS: In total we  identified 14 different GPB bacterial species, however Staphylococci was  dominant. These findings highlight the need of a prospective genomic epidemiology  study to comprehensively assess the true burden of GPB neonatal sepsis focusing  specifically on mechanisms of resistance and virulence across species and in  relation to neonatal outcome.},

  abstract = {CONTENT: Healthy People 2030 (HP2030), the fifth iteration of the Healthy People initiative, provides science-based national health objectives with targets to improve the health and well-being of Americans. For the first time since its 1979 establishment, the Healthy People framework aims to attain health literacy as an Overarching Goal and Foundational Principle to achieving health and well-being. Growing literature on health literacy describes it as a concept not solely reliant on individual capabilities but also on organizations' ability to make health-related information and services equitably accessible and comprehensible. PROGRAM: The US Department of Health \& Human Services (HHS) updates the Healthy People objectives each decade based on the most current science. For the development of HP2030, the HHS drew on recommendations from the Secretary's Advisory Committee on National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives for 2030 (Secretary's Advisory Committee), an independent advisory committee of national health experts, to update the 20-year old individual-focused Healthy People definition of health literacy. The HHS solicited input from members of the public and stakeholders on the proposed changes to that definition. IMPLEMENTATION: The HHS published a federal register notice to solicit public comments, which were qualitatively analyzed by government staff. EVALUATION: The 2 separate analyses revealed plurality support for improving the definition to focus on both individual and organizational roles in health literacy. Results led HHS subject matter experts to update the definition to include definitions of personal health literacy and organizational health literacy. Healthy People 2030's expanded health literacy definition reflects the most current science and input from the Secretary's Advisory Committee, public comments, and HHS subject matter experts. DISCUSSION: The updated definition is intended to advance HP2030's health literacy goals particularly as more organizations in public health and other sectors acknowledge their role in the delivery of quality health information and services.},

We considered 126 patients from a randomized population recovered in RSA of Viagrande (Catania) in the period from 1st March, 2005 and 31st March, 2007. Those who proved to be demented according to the DSM-III diagnostic protocols, and having a mini mental state examination (MMSE)-score {$<$}24 were divided in 2 groups: Group A, all the demented people without the DLB; and Group B, the DLB patients, according to the diagnostic criteria of McKeith. All patients underwent at admission, after 1 month, and at emission the following psychometric and functional tests: MMSE, geriatric depression scale (GDS) [Yesavage J.A., Brink T.L., Rose T.L., Adey M., 1983. The development and validation of geriatric depression screening scale: a preliminary report. J. Psych. Res. 17, 37], Barthel index (BI), activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL). Particular attention was dedicated to the presence of delirium during the last 15 days before the admission and during the recovery, the mortality and the prevalence of other complaints. The observed data confirm the prevalence of fragility of DLB patients in 20\% of them, a fluctuation of the cognitive capacities, a better recovery of the affectivity, a reduced functional autonomy and autosufficiency. In addition, the DLB patients display a major presence of prevalent delirium, compared to the total population of demented patients, while in this last population only incidental delirium episodes occurred during the recovery period (31.6\% vs. 16.6\%; p{$<$}0.001). In the DLB population decubital lesions occurred more frequently, and were of more severe staging, compared to the controls (45\% vs. 27\%; p{$<$}0.001). Also, the mortality of the DLB patients was higher (about 30\% vs. 17\% in 12 months). These data confirm the particularity and higher complexity of the DLB patients recovered in the RSA.},

Yet many physicians do not recognize the problem or is not skilled enough to approach the subject with their patients. In this review, important aspects of HL, such as its epidemiology, associations with poor outcomes, assessment, determinants and interventions, particularly in nephrology, are discussed. Because it is common and associated to adverse clinical outcomes, inadequate HL should be incorporated into the list of assessments of patients with renal disease.},

METHOD: Cross-sectional study conducted in February 2011, by designing and conducting a structured questionnaire on 60 patients: 30 inpatients and 30 outpatients. Descriptive analysis of the results was performed including, number and level of knowledge of medication treatment versus the "real" one, globally analysed by age and route of administration. RESULTS: A total of 234 drugs were analysed in the inpatient group. It was considered that 45/234 (19.2\%;95\% CI: 14-25) were known properly by patients. In outpatients, this rises to 29/42 (69.0\%;95\% CI: 53-82). One third (33.3\%) of patients check the medication before it is administered or provided. Inpatients are more aware of orally administered drugs, they knew 28.6\% vs 5.1\% of parenteral treatments. Just under half (45.3\%) of inpatients and 2.4\% of outpatients completely unknown the medication. The average age of patients with no knowledge of their medication was 68.5 years (SD=10.1) and had 8.7 drugs prescribed (SD=3.0). A total of 53.3\% of inpatients and 93.3\% of outpatients, considered to have been properly informed. Most of patients (96.7\%) were satisfied with the information received. CONCLUSIONS: The results show an opportunity for improvement in the information given to patients, particularly to inpatients. To inform them, would enable them to act as a filter to potential medication errors, and as a necessary part to improve the safety of care.},

TTs were identified based on published recommendations. Traits that predicted decline in lung function and QoL were analysed using generalised estimating equations.Results Overall, 21 TTs, including pulmonary (n=5), extra-pulmonary (n=13) and behavioural/lifestyle risk-factors (n=3) were identified. In multivariate analyses, the traits of chronic bronchitis ({$\beta$} -0.186, 95\% CI -0.290 to -0.082), breathlessness ({$\beta$} -0.093, 95\% CI -0.164 to -0.022), underweight ({$\beta$} -0.216, 95\% CI -0.373 to -0.058), sarcopenia ({$\beta$} -0.162, 95\% CI -0.262 to -0.061) and current smoking ({$\beta$} -0.228, 95\% CI -0.304 to -0.153) predicted decline in forced expiratory volume in 1\>s (FEV1). Of the seven traits that predicted decline in QoL, depression ({$\beta$} -7.19, 95\% CI -8.81 to -5.57) and poor family and social support ({$\beta$} -5.12, 95\% CI -6.65 to -3.59) were the strongest.Conclusion The core TTs of COPD associated with a decline in lung function and QoL were identified. Targeting these impactful traits with individualised treatment using a precision medicine approach may improve outcomes in people with COPD.Targeting the traits of chronic bronchitis, breathlessness, underweight, sarcopenia, depression, smoking, and poor family and social support may significantly improve health outcomes in people with COPD https://bit.ly/3cLHIPV},

  abstract = {Adolescence is the phase of life stretching between childhood and adulthood, and its definition has long posed a conundrum. Adolescence encompasses elements of biological growth and major social role transitions, both of which have changed in the past century. Earlier puberty has accelerated the onset of adolescence in nearly all populations, while understanding of continued growth has lifted its endpoint age well into the 20s. In parallel, delayed timing of role transitions, including completion of education, marriage, and parenthood, continue to shift popular perceptions of when adulthood begins. Arguably, the transition period from childhood to adulthood now occupies a greater portion of the life course than ever before at a time when unprecedented social forces, including marketing and digital media, are affecting health and wellbeing across these years. An expanded and more inclusive definition of adolescence is essential for developmentally appropriate framing of laws, social policies, and service systems. Rather than age 10-19 years, a definition of 10-24 years corresponds more closely to adolescent growth and popular understandings of this life phase and would facilitate extended investments across a broader range of settings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To reach the Millennium Development Goals for health, influential international bodies advocate for more resources to be directed to the health sector, in particular medical treatment. Yet, health has many determinants beyond the health sector that are less evident than proximate predictors. AIM: To assess the relative importance of major socioeconomic determinants of population health, measured as infant mortality rate (IMR), at country level. METHODS: National-level data from 152 countries based on World Development Indicators 2003 were used for multivariate linear regression analyses of five socioeconomic predictors of IMR: public spending on health, GNI/capita, poverty rate, income equality (Gini index), and young female illiteracy rate. Analyses were performed on a global level and stratified for low-, middle-, and high-income countries. RESULTS: In order of importance, GNI/capita, young female illiteracy, and income equality predicted 92\% of the variation in national IMR whereas public spending on health and poverty rate were non-significant determinants when adjusted for confounding. In low-income countries, female illiteracy was more important than GNI/capita. Income equality (Gini index) was an independent predictor of IMR in middle-income countries only. In high-income countries none of these predictors was significant. CONCLUSIONS: The relative importance of major health determinants varies between income levels, thus extrapolating health policies from high- to low-income countries is problematic. Since the size, per se, of public health spending does not independently predict health outcomes, functioning health systems are necessary to make health investments efficient. Potential health gains from improved female education and economic growth should be considered in low- and middle-income countries.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Case reports have suggested a link between human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and development of multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases. OBJECTIVE: To investigate if quadrivalent HPV (qHPV) vaccination is associated with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using nationwide registers we identified a cohort of all females aged 10 years to 44 years in Denmark and Sweden, followed up from 2006 to 2013, information on qHPV vaccination, and data on incident diagnoses of multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases. The primary analysis used a cohort design including vaccinated and unvaccinated study participants. A secondary analysis used a self-controlled case-series design including only cases. Both analyses used a 2-year risk period following vaccination. EXPOSURES: Information on qHPV vaccination was obtained through the national vaccination and prescription registers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were multiple sclerosis and a composite end point of other demyelinating diseases. Incidence rate ratios were estimated using Poisson regression, comparing rates of events in the 2-year risk periods following vaccination and in unvaccinated time periods. RESULTS: The study included 3,983,824 females, among whom 789,082 received a total of 1,927,581 qHPV vaccine doses. During follow-up, 4322 multiple sclerosis cases and 3300 cases of other demyelinating diseases were identified, of which 73 and 90, respectively, occurred within the risk period. In the cohort analysis, there was no increased risk of multiple sclerosis (crude incidence rates, 6.12 events/100,000 person-years [95\% CI, 4.86-7.69] and 21.54 events/100,000 person-years [95\% CI, 20.90-22.20] for the vaccinated and unvaccinated periods; adjusted rate ratio, 0.90 [95\% CI, 0.70-1.15]) or other demyelinating diseases (crude incidence rates, 7.54 events/100,000 person-years [95\% CI, 6.13-9.27] and 16.14 events/100,000 person-years [95\% CI, 15.58-16.71]; adjusted rate ratio, 1.00 [95\% CI, 0.80-1.26]) associated with qHPV vaccination. Similarly, no increased risk was found using the self-controlled case-series design (multiple sclerosis: incidence ratio, 1.05 [95\% CI, 0.79-1.38]; other demyelinating diseases: incidence ratio, 1.14 [95\% CI, 0.88-1.47]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study with nationwide coverage of 2 Scandinavian countries, qHPV vaccination was not associated with the development of multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating diseases. These findings do not support concerns about a causal relationship between qHPV vaccination and demyelinating diseases.},

RESULTS: Specific mRNA extracted from blood leucocytes showed a different level of pro-inflammatory gene activation: TNF-alpha mRNA and IL-6 mRNA diminished in the OS group after 12 weeks, while no changes were detected in the control group (P=0.05 and P=0.04 respectively). Serum levels of sCD14, a product shed by activated macrophages, decreased only in the OS group without reaching statistical significance (P=0.08). No significant differences were detected in the fecal gut flora or in the nutritional parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the administration of supplements in older persons at risk of malnutrition may benefit from the addition of prebiotics that can improve the low noise inflammatory process frequently observed in this population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As many other European healthcare systems the Danish healthcare system (DHS) has targeted chronic condition care in its reform efforts. Benchmarking is a valuable tool to identify areas for improvement. Prior work indicates that chronic care coordination is poor in the DHS, especially in comparison with care in Kaiser Permanente (KP), an integrated delivery system based in the United States. We investigated population rates of hospitalisation and readmission rates for ambulatory care sensitive, chronic medical conditions in the two systems. METHODS: Using a historical cohort study design, age and gender adjusted population rates of hospitalisations for angina, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypertension, plus rates of 30-day readmission and mortality were investigated for all individuals aged 65+ in the DHS and KP. RESULTS: DHS had substantially higher rates of hospitalisations, readmissions, and mean lengths of stay per hospitalisation, than KP had. For example, the adjusted angina hospitalisation rates in 2007 for the DHS and KP respectively were 1.01/100 persons (95\%CI: 0.98-1.03) vs. 0.11/100 persons (95\%CI: 0.10-0.13/100 persons); 21.6\% vs. 9.9\% readmission within 30 days (OR = 2.53; 95\% CI: 1.84-3.47); and mean length of stay was 2.52 vs. 1.80 hospital days. Mortality up through 30 days post-discharge was not consistently different in the two systems. CONCLUSIONS: There are substantial differences between the DHS and KP in the rates of preventable hospitalisations and subsequent readmissions associated with chronic conditions, which suggest much opportunity for improvement within the Danish healthcare system. Reductions in hospitalisations also could improve patient welfare and free considerable resources for use towards preventing disease exacerbations. These conclusions may also apply for similar public systems such as the US Medicare system, the NHS and other systems striving to improve the integration of care for persons with chronic conditions.},

  abstract = {Objective: To define and improve the performance of existing comorbidity scores in predicting mortality in Medicare enrollees. Data Sources: Study participants were two Medicare populations who had complete drug coverage either through Medicaid or a statewide pharmacy assistance program: New Jersey Medicare enrollees (NNJ=235,881) and Pennsylvania Medicare enrollees (NPA=230,913). Study Design: Frequently used comorbidity scores were computed for all subjects during the baseline year (January 1, 1994, to December 31, 1994, and one year later in Pennsylvania). The study outcome was one-year mortality during the following year. Performance of scores was measured with the c-statistic derived from multivariate logistic regression models. Empirical weights were derived in the New Jersey population and the performance of scores with new weights was validated in the Pennsylvania population. Principal Findings: A score based on ICD-9-diagnoses (Romano) performed 60 percent better than one based on patterns of medication use (Chronic Disease Score, or CDS-1) (c=0.771 vs. c=0.703). The performance of the Romano score was further improved slightly by inclusion of the number of different prescription drugs used during the past year. Modeling the 17 conditions included in the Romano score as separate binary indicators increased its performance by 8 percent (c=0.781). We derived elderly-specific weights for these scores in the New Jersey sample, including negative weights for the use of some drugs, for example, lipid lowering drugs. Applying these weights, the performance of Romano and CDS-1 scores improved in an independent validation sample of Pennsylvania Medicare enrollees by 8.3 percent and 43 percent compared to the scores with the original weights. When we added an indicator of nursing home residency, age, and gender, the Romano score reached a performance of c=0.80. Conclusions: We conclude that in epidemiologic studies of the elderly, a modified diagnosis-based score using empirically derived weights provides improved adjustment for comorbidity and enhances the validity of findings.},

METHODS: The authors have performed a selective literature search to enable a proper distinction to be drawn between scientifically justified and unjustified reports on the potential adverse effects of vaccination. RESULTS: At present, the safety of a new vaccine must be demonstrated in large-scale clinical trials before the product is licensed. After licensing, the safety of new vaccines is constantly monitored, and the results of monitoring are published.

During the preparation phase, a survey was performed addressing the German general population. OBJECTIVES: To gain insights into the knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of nonprescribers concerning AB and multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO). METHODS: Using computer-assisted, telephone-based interviews a random sample of 1,004 persons aged 14 years and older was surveyed. Descriptive reporting of data and multivariate analysis were performed, including sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: Only 24 \% of participants knew that bacteria (but not viruses or humans) could develop AB resistance. However, this knowledge did not influence the outcome of other questions. Regardless of knowledge, 71 \% thought that the subject was important, but 58 \% did not believe in the influence of their own behavior on MDRO development. When visiting a physician, patients were given an antibiotic three times as often as information on AB resistance. 17 \% did not take the AB as prescribed and 20 \% of all participants stated that they personally knew at least one person with MDRO problems. This personal involvement had a significant effect on the rating of self-influence, on the importance of the subject, on the interaction between patient and physician (more information, less AB), and on AB intake compliance (less frequent). DISCUSSION: We found considerable knowledge gaps, but this had no impact on the assessment of the subject. A starting point for an intervention could be patient-physician communication. This seems more effective and safer than a public campaign.},

  abstract = {Aim: To measure the extent of polypharmacy, multimorbidity and potential medication-related problems in elderly patients with chronic pain receiving home care. Methods: Data of 355 patients aged {$\geq$}65~years affected by chronic pain in home care who were enrolled in the ACHE study in Berlin, Germany, were analyzed. History of chronic diseases, diagnoses, medications including self-medication were collected for all patients. Multimorbidity was defined as the presence of {$\geq$}2 chronic conditions and levels were classified by the Charlson-Comorbidity-Index. Polypharmacy was defined as the concomitant intake of {$\geq$}5 medications. Potentially clinically relevant drug interactions were identified and evaluated; underuse of potentially useful medications as well as overprescription were also assessed. Results: More than half of the patients (55.4\%) had moderate to severe comorbidity levels. The median number of prescribed drugs was 9 (range 0-25) and polypharmacy was detected in 89.5\% of the patients. Almost half of them (49.3\%) were affected by excessive polypharmacy ({$\geq$}10 prescribed drugs). Polypharmacy and excessive polypharmacy occurred at all levels of comorbidity. We detected 184 potentially relevant drug interactions in 120/353 (34.0\%) patients and rated 57 (31.0\%) of them as severe. Underprescription of oral anticoagulants was detected in 32.3\% of patients with atrial fibrillation whereas potential overprescription of loop diuretics was observed in 15.5\% of patients. Conclusion: Multimorbidity and polypharmacy are highly prevalent in elderly outpatients with chronic pain receiving home care. Medication-related problems that could impair safety of drug treatment in this population are resulting from potentially relevant drug interactions, overprescribing as well as underuse.},

  abstract = {Background: Although there is no strict definition of frailty, it is generally accepted as a state of high vulnerability for adverse health outcomes at older age. Associations between frailty and mortality, dependence, and hospitalization have been shown. We measured the frailty level of older people with intellectual disabilities (ID). Furthermore variation in gender, age, and level of ID were identified. Results were compared to a frailty study in the general European population. Methods: This research elaborates on a large cross-sectional study: Healthy Ageing with Intellectual Disability (HA-ID). Nine hundred-eighty-two men and women ({$\geq$}50. yr) with ID were included. Based on the collected data, we developed a frailty index with 51 health-related deficits, and calculated a frailty index score between 0 and 1 for each individual. Deficits included physical, social and psychological problems. Results: The mean frailty index score was 0.27 (standard deviation .13). Frailty was positively correlated with age (r=0.297, p{$<$}. 001). More severe ID was associated with higher frailty scores ({$\beta$}=0.440, p{$<$}. 001). The upper limit of the FI was 0.69, which was consistent for all age categories. Conclusion: As people with ID are getting older, the question whether additional years are spent in good health becomes salient. Here, people with ID over age 50 had frailty scores similar to most elderly people over 75. y. Future research is needed to confirm if frail elderly people with ID have an increased risk of adverse health outcomes. {\copyright} 2013.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Goals of care (GoC) conversations optimally begin early in the course of cancer care, yet most happen near the end of life. We sought to describe oncologist-reported facilitators of and barriers to GoC conversations with patients who have advanced cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We conducted individual, semistructured qualitative interviews with oncologists from 4 academic, community, municipal, and rural hospitals in New York and Connecticut. Interview topics included approach to GoC conversations, facilitators, barriers, and organizational influences. We analyzed data using interpretive description. We collected demographic and practice information and surveyed oncologists on their communication skills training. We calculated descriptive statistics for quantitative data. RESULTS: Oncologists (n = 21) had a mean age of 46 years (range: 34-68), 67\% were male, 71\% were White, 24\% were Asian, 10\% were Hispanic, and 5\% were Black. They reported an average of 20 years in practice (range: 8-42), and 62\% had received training on having GoC conversations. Facilitators included patient's poor functional status, patient's high health literacy, family understanding and acceptance, oncologist's practice experience, and a supportive practice environment. Barriers included certain patient demographic and clinical characteristics, patient religion and culture, patient's denial, and lack of time. CONCLUSION: GoC conversations may be facilitated by enabling oncologists to conduct these conversations despite difficult circumstances and emotional reactions by activating patients and family via increased health literacy and by advancing palliative-informed practice environments.},

Thousands of published empirical studies and dozens of reviews have documented the psychological and physical health effects of caregiving, identified caregivers at risk for adverse outcomes, and evaluated a wide range of intervention strategies to support caregivers. Caregiving as chronic stress exposure is the conceptual driver for much of this research. We review and synthesize the literature on the impact of caregiving and intervention strategies for supporting caregivers. The impact of caregiving is highly variable, driven largely by the intensity of care provided and the suffering of the care recipient. The intervention literature is littered with many failures and some successes. Successful interventions address both the pragmatics of care and the emotional toll of caregiving. We conclude with both research and policy recommendations that address a national agenda for caregiving.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interpreting health information and acquiring health knowledge have become more important with the accumulation of scientific medical knowledge and ideals of patient autonomy. Health literacy and its tremendous success as a concept can be considered an admission that not all is well in the distribution of health knowledge. The internet makes health information much more easily accessible than ever, but it introduces its own problems, of which health disinformation is a major one. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether objective and subjective health literacy are independent concepts and to test which of the two was associated more strongly with accurate judgments of the quality of a medical website and with behavioral intentions beneficial to health. METHODS: A survey on depression and its treatments was conducted online (n=362). The Newest Vital Sign was employed to measure objective, performance-based health literacy, and the eHealth Literacy Scale was used to measure subjective, perception-based health literacy. Correlations, comparisons of means, linear and binary logistic regression, and mediation models were used to determine the associations. RESULTS: Objective and subjective health literacy were weakly associated with one another (r=0.06, P=.24). High objective health literacy levels were associated with an inclination to behave in ways that are beneficial to one's own or others' health (Exp[B]=2.068, P=.004) and an ability to recognize low-quality online sources of health information (beta=-.4698, P=.005). The recognition also improved participants' choice of treatment (beta=-.3345, P{$<$}.001). Objective health literacy helped people to recognize misinformation on health websites and improved their judgment on their treatment for depression. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported, perception-based health literacy should be treated as a separate concept from objective, performance-based health literacy. Only objective health literacy appears to have the potential to prevent people from becoming victims of health disinformation.},

The yardstick for assessing the tool was the Newest Vital Sign (NVS). METHODS: The study used baseline data from the V{\"a}sterbotten Intervention Programme - VIsualiZation of Asymptomatic Atherosclerotic disease for Optimum Cardiovascular Prevention (VIPVIZA), a randomized controlled trial that is nested within the V{\"a}sterbotten Intervention Program (VIP) in Sweden. Our analyses were computed on a subsample of 460 persons who underwent the measure of both health literacy scales. ROC analysis was used for the crucial computations. RESULTS: The potential of the BHLS to identify healthcare consumers with inadequate health literacy remained unsatisfying for the complete sample, but reached an acceptable level for women and persons with only basic education. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship is somewhat weaker than in comparable research in various other European countries. The differences might partly have been caused by the use of self-perception questions. Self-delusions, invariably a part of self-perception, may have affected the respective measure. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Caution is advised when patients' health literacy is assessed by only a few questions for self-report.},

  abstract = {Current hypertension guidelines recommend using the average values of several blood pressure (BP) readings obtained both in and out of the office for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. In-office BP measurement using an upper-arm cuff constitutes the evidencebased reference method for current BP classification and treatment targets. However, out-ofoffice BP evaluation using 24\,h ambulatory or home BP monitoring is recommended by all major medical associations for obtaining further insights into the BP profile of an individual and how it relates to their daily activities. Importantly, the highly variable nature of office and out-of-office BP readings has been widely acknowledged, including the association of BP variability with cardio\- vascular outcomes. However, to date, the implications of BP variability on cardiovascular outcomes have largely been ignored, with limited application in clinical practice. Novel cuffless wearable technologies might provide a detailed assessment of the 24\,h BP profile and behaviour over weeks or months. These devices offer many advantages for researchers and patients compared with traditional BP monitors, but their accuracy and utility remain uncertain. In this Review, we outline and compare conventional and novel methods and techniques for assessing average BP levels and BP variability, and reflect on the utility and potential of these methods for improving the treatment and management of patients with hypertension.},

  abstract = {Inappropriate polypharmacy in older patients imposes a significant burden of decreased physical functioning, increased risk of falls, delirium and other geriatric syndromes, hospital admissions and death. The single most important predictor of inappropriate prescribing and risk of adverse drug events in older patients is the number of prescribed medications. Deprescribing is the process of tapering or stopping drugs, with the goal of minimising polypharmacy and improving outcomes. Barriers to deprescribing include underappreciation of the scale of polypharmacy-related harm by both patients and prescribers; multiple incentives to overprescribe; a narrow focus on lists of potentially inappropriate medications; reluctance of prescribers and patients to discontinue medication for fear of unfavourable sequelae; and uncertainty about effectiveness of strategies to reduce polypharmacy. Ways of countering such barriers comprise reframing the issue to one of highest quality patient-centred care; openly discussing benefit-harm trade-offs with patients and assessing their willingness to consider deprescribing; targeting patients according to highest risk of adverse drug events; targeting drugs more likely to be non-beneficial; accessing field-tested discontinuation regimens for specific drugs; fostering shared education and training in deprescribing among all members of the health care team; and undertaking deprescribing over an extended time frame under the supervision of a single generalist clinician.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unplanned readmissions befall up to 25\% of acutely hospitalised older patients, and many may be potentially preventable. AIM: To assess the type and prevalence of quality of care factors associated with potentially preventable readmissions to a tertiary hospital general medicine service. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was undertaken of hospital records of patients 65 years or older admitted acutely between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2010. Readmissions up to 30 days postdischarge (cases) were purposively sampled according to frequencies of primary discharge diagnoses coded during the study period. Non-readmitted patients (controls), matched according to age, sex and primary discharge diagnosis on index admission, were selected in a 1.7:1 ratio. RESULTS: One hundred and thirteen cases and 198 controls were analysed, the former demonstrating a significantly higher comorbidity burden (mean ({\textpm}standard deviation) comorbidity score 6.6 ({\textpm}2.2) vs 5.6 ({\textpm}2.4), P = 0.003) and a higher proportion of individuals with one or more hospitalisations over the preceding 6 months (55.7\% vs 8.1\%, P {$<$} 0.001). Among readmitted patients, 50 (44.3\%) were associated with one or more quality factors versus 23 (11.6\%) controls (P {$<$} 0.001). The most common were: failure to develop/activate an advance care plan (18, 15.9\% vs 2, 1.0\%; P {$<$} 0.001); suboptimal management of presenting illness (13, 11.4\% vs 0, 0\%; P {$<$} 0.001); inadequate assessment of functional limitations (11, 9.7\% vs 0, 0\%; P {$<$} 0.001); and potentially preventable complication of therapy (8, 7.1\% vs 1, 0.5\%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Quality of care factors are more common among readmitted than among non-readmitted older patients suggesting potential for remedial strategies. Such strategies may still have limited effects as older, frail patients with advanced diseases and multimorbidity will likely retain a high propensity for readmission despite optimal care.},

The single most important predictor of inappropriate prescribing and risk of adverse drug events in older patients is the number of prescribed drugs. Deprescribing is the process of tapering or stopping drugs, aimed at minimizing polypharmacy and improving patient outcomes. Evidence of efficacy for deprescribing is emerging from randomized trials and observational studies. A deprescribing protocol is proposed comprising 5 steps: (1) ascertain all drugs the patient is currently taking and the reasons for each one; (2) consider overall risk of drug-induced harm in individual patients in determining the required intensity of deprescribing intervention; (3) assess each drug in regard to its current or future benefit potential compared with current or future harm or burden potential; (4) prioritize drugs for discontinuation that have the lowest benefit-harm ratio and lowest likelihood of adverse withdrawal reactions or disease rebound syndromes; and (5) implement a discontinuation regimen and monitor patients closely for improvement in outcomes or onset of adverse effects. Whereas patient and prescriber barriers to deprescribing exist, resources and strategies are available that facilitate deliberate yet judicious deprescribing and deserve wider application.},

  abstract = {This exploratory study examined the impact of health literacy on quality of life (QoL) in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy (TRE). Health literacy is a discrete form of literacy in which an individual can readily interpret prose and apply that skill to understand medical, pharmaceutical, and self-management information. From the perspectives of cultural health capital (CHC) and social disability theory, we hypothesized that greater levels of health literacy would be associated with a higher QoL score. The sample (n\,=\,79) included adult patients with TRE enrolled in the University of Alabama at Birmingham Cannabidiol Program. The data were analyzed by using nested linear regression. Respondents aged 19-63\,years (mean, standard deviation [SD]\,=\,32.9 [13.65]) and were 92\% white; 44\% of patients were in Special Education until age 21\,years, and 29\% reported a total annual family income of less than \$25,000. Significant bivariate relationships were found between health literacy and QoL (p\,=\,.004), age (p\,=\,.0001), and income (p\,=\,.036). There was a significant difference in health literacy scores for patients who completed high school or less (mean [SD]\,=\,0.68 [0.86]) and those with any postsecondary education (mean [SD]\,=\,1.59 [1.0]). The regression results showed health literacy to be positively associated with QoL where a 1\% increase in health literacy was associated with a 6.61-point increase in QoL (p\,=\,.004), and this pattern persisted through each addition of other independent factors and control variables. This is one of the first studies investigating the role of health literacy in QoL among patients with TRE. The results suggest that health literacy is important and may function as a tool through which healthcare participation is expanded. Further research is needed with larger, more diverse, and longitudinal samples to accurately model the development of health literacy and its impact on QoL in this population.},

The idea underlying cumulative disadvantage is that socioeconomic-based health inequalities will increase across the life course, mostly because of differential exposure to risk factors and access to protective resources. The advantage of life course sociology is its consideration of early life experiences, and the social and historical context of their occurrences, as important contingencies in producing these systematic socioeconomic differences in health gradients.},

Our objective is to systematically describe a standard procedure for constructing a frailty index.METHODS:This is a secondary analysis of the Yale Precipitating Events Project cohort study, based in New Haven CT. Non-disabled people aged 70 years or older (n = 754) were enrolled and re-contacted every 18 months. The database includes variables on function, cognition, co-morbidity, health attitudes and practices and physical performance measures. Data came from the baseline cohort and those available at the first 18-month follow-up assessment.RESULTS:Procedures for selecting health variables as candidate deficits were applied to yield 40 deficits. Recoding procedures were applied for categorical, ordinal and interval variables such that they could be mapped to the interval 0-1, where 0 = absence of a deficit, and 1= full expression of the deficit. These individual deficit scores were combined in an index, where 0= no deficit present, and 1= all 40 deficits present. The values of the index were well fit by a gamma distribution. Between the baseline and follow-up cohorts, the age-related slope of deficit accumulation increased from 0.020 (95\% confidence interval, 0.014-0.026) to 0.026 (0.020-0.032). The 99\% limit to deficit accumulation was 0.6 in the baseline cohort and 0.7 in the follow-up cohort. Multivariate Cox analysis showed the frailty index, age and sex to be significant predictors of mortality.CONCLUSION:A systematic process for creating a frailty index, which relates deficit accumulation to the individual risk of death, showed reproducible properties in the Yale Precipitating Events Project cohort study. This method of quantifying frailty can aid our understanding of frailty-related health characteristics in older adults.},

Readmission was defined as any return to the hospital within 30 days of prior hospital discharge. PAHs were defined as hospitalizations for conditions that previously established criteria have identified as possibly preventable or manageable without hospitalization. RESULTS: Rate of hospitalization was 539/1,000, vs 962/1,000 for dually eligible aged or disabled waiver (ADW) enrollees. Thirty-day readmission was 19.3\%, compared with 22.9\% for the national population of dually eligible older enrollees. PAH rate was 100/1,000, compared with 250/1,000 for dually eligible ADW enrollees. Considerable variation was observed between sites. CONCLUSION: PACE enrollees experienced lower rates of hospitalization, readmission, and PAH than similar populations.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted to find out the bacterial causes of early onset neonatal sepsis and their susceptibility pattern for different classes of  antibiotics in neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of  Mansoura-Egypt. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. All  admitted newborns to our study were infants at {$<$}72 hours of age with clinical  features of sepsis or product of an in-house delivery at Mansoura University  Hospital with risk factors for neonatal sepsis. Identification of Gram-negative  isolates was confirmed by API 20E kits (bioMerieux). Antibiotic susceptibility  was performed by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Bacteria resistant to {$\geq$}3  antimicrobial classes were counted as multidrug resistant. RESULTS: One hundred  eighty eight babies were admitted to our study. Positive blood culture was  reported in 34.6\% of newborn infants with prevalence of 4.02/1,000 live births.  The most common isolated bacteria in early onset neonatal sepsis were coagulase  negative staphylococci followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens.  The Gram-positive bacteria showed high resistance to ampicillin 93.9\% while all  the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. The isolated Gram-negative bacteria  were highly resistant to ampicillin [96.9\%], amoxicillin-clavulanic acid [90.6\%],  cefotaxime [84.4\%] and ceftazidime [84.4\%]. Best sensitivity among all isolates  was observed to imipenem. Multidrug resistance was observed among 45.5\% of the  Gram-positive and 68.8\% of Gram-negative isolates. CONCLUSION: Appropriate  identification of the source of infection and initiation of an effective  management can reduce both mortality and morbidity associated with neonatal  sepsis. The challenge is to initiate immediate empirical antibiotic therapy  according to a strictly implemented updated antibiotic policy based on an  individualized community established antimicrobial sensitivity pattern of  microorganisms causing early onset neonatal sepsis.},

With virtually all new contributors and content, this edition contains 35 chapters by the most highly respected luminaries in the field. It addresses theories and concepts built on cumulative knowledge in four disciplinary areas - biology, psychology, social sciences, and policy and practice - as well as landmark advances in trans-disciplinary science. With its explicit focus on theory, the handbook is unique in providing essential knowledge about primary explanations for aging, spanning from cells to societies. The chapters in the third edition place a strong emphasis on the future of theory development, assessing the current state of theories and providing a roadmap for how theory can shape research, and vice versa, in years to come. Many chapters also address connections between theories and policy or practice. Each set of authors has been asked to consider how theories in their area address matters of diversity and inequalities in aging, and how theories might be revised or tested with these matters in mind. The third edition also contains a new section, "Standing on the Shoulders of Giants", which includes personal essays by senior gerontologists who share their perspectives on the history of ideas in their fields, and on their experiences with the process and prospects of developing good theory. Hallmarks of the third edition: * Highlights important gains in trans-disciplinary theories of aging.* Emphasizes the future of theory development.* Provides insights on theory development from living legends in gerontology.* Examines what human diversity and inequality mean for aging theories.* Emphasizes interconnections between theory, research, intervention, and policy.* Underscores international issues with greater representation of international authors.* Includes section introductions by the editors and associate editors that summarize theoretical developments. Key Features: * Highlights variability and diversity in aging processes, from the cellular level of biological aging to the societal level of public policy.* Provides insights on theory development from living legends in gerontology.* Offers intergenerational, interdisciplinary, and international perspectives.*},

  abstract = {AIM: To investigate the lifestyles, physical performance and quality of life (QOL) of frail and robust Brazilian community-dwelling older women, and to identify risk factors for frailty. METHODS: Frailty was assessed using the Kihon Checklist. Lifestyles were assessed using a questionnaire. Physical performance was assessed by measuring walking speeds, performance on the one-leg stand test and the five-times chair stand test and handgrip strength. QOL was assessed using the Short Form-8 questionnaire. Participants were divided into frail and robust groups based on their total Kihon Checklist scores. RESULTS: A total of 109 participants (age 70.8 +/- 6.87 years) were included in this study (robust n = 85, frail n = 24). Differences in living structures (P {$<$} 0.001), financial satisfaction (P = 0.004) and the frequencies with which participants leave the house (P {$<$} 0.001) were found between groups. The frail group had more fallers (P = 0.047), and lower engagement in physical activity (P = 0.044), lower body mass indices (P = 0.043) and poorer nutritional status (P = 0.002), whereas robust older people showed better physical performance (walking speed P {$<$} 0.001, one-leg stand P = 0.021, handgrip strength P = 0.002) and higher QOL scores (general health P = 0.005, role-physical P = 0.013, bodily pain P = 0.002, vitality P = 0.001, social functioning P = 0.001, role-emotional P = 0.008). Multivariate regression analysis identified a slow usual walking speed and bodily pain as risk factors for frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Frail participants had higher indices for being housebound, and having financial dissatisfaction, a sedentary lifestyle, falls, and malnutrition. Furthermore, they showed poorer physical performance and QOL. An early, well-focused approach is crucial, especially for older adults who walk slowly and have bodily pain to preserve health and QOL.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is safe and effective but is typically administered under strict clinic observation to mitigate the risk of a systemic reaction to immunotherapy (SRIT). However, in the setting of the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, alternative care models should be explored. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of home immunotherapy self-administration (HITSA) in a highly idealized circumstance for provision of maintenance AIT in a shelter-in-place or other scenarios of unforeseen reduction in nonessential medical services. METHODS: Markov modeling was used to compare in-office clinic AIT in selected patients using cohort analysis and microsimulation from the societal and health care perspectives. RESULTS: Assuming similar SRIT rates, HITSA was found to be a cost-effective option with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \$44,554/quality-adjusted life-year when considering both incremental epinephrine autoinjector costs and coronavirus disease 2019 risks. Excluding epinephrine autoinjector costs, HISTA dominated other options. However, outside of pandemic considerations, HITSA was not cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, \$198,877,286) at annual epinephrine autoinjector costs above \$287. As the incremental HITSA SRIT rate increased above 15\%, clinic AIT was the most cost-effective strategy. Excluding both pandemic risks and risk of motor vehicle accident fatality from round-trip clinic transit, clinic AIT dominated other strategies. Clinic AIT was the more cost-effective option at very high fatality relative risk for HITSA or at very low annual risk of contracting coronavirus disease~2019. CONCLUSIONS: Under idealized assumptions HITSA can be a safe and cost-effective option during a global pandemic in appropriately selected patients provided home rates of SRIT remain stable.},

Definitions of frailty vary widely, and prevalence estimates are affected by the way frailty is defined. Systematic reviews have yet to examine the literature on the association between definitions of frailty and mortality. We examined the definitions and prevalence of frailty and its association with survival in older community-dwelling adults. We conducted a systematic review of observational population-based studies published in English. We calculated pooled prevalence of frailty with a random effects model. We identified 24 population-based studies that examined frailty in community-dwelling older adults. The pooled prevalence was 14\% when frailty was defined as a phenotype exhibiting three or more of the following: weight loss, fatigue/exhaustion, weakness, low physical activity/slowness, and mobility impairment. The pooled prevalence was 24\% when frailty was defined by accumulation of deficits indices that included up to 75 diseases and impairments. The prevalence of frailty increased with age and was greater in women and in African Americans. Frailty in older adults was associated with poor survival with a dose-responsive reduction in survival per increasing number of frailty criteria. Taking into account population prevalence and multivariate adjusted relative risks, we estimated that 3-5\% of deaths among older adults could be delayed if frailty was prevented. Frailty is a prevalent and important geriatric syndrome associated with decreased survival. Geriatric assessment of frailty provides clinically important information about functional status and survival of older adults. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Poor cognition has been observed in children and adolescents with youth-onset type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared with control subjects without diabetes. Differences in cognition between youth-onset T1D and T2D, however, are not known. Thus, using data from SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth, a multicenter, observational cohort study, we tested the association between diabetes type and cognitive function in adolescents and young adults with T1D (n = 1,095) or T2D (n = 285). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cognition was assessed via the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery, and age-corrected composite Fluid Cognition scores were used as the primary outcome. Confounder-adjusted linear regression models were run. Model 1 included diabetes type and clinical site. Model 2 additionally included sex, race/ethnicity, waist-to-height ratio, diabetes duration, depressive symptoms, glycemic control, any hypoglycemic episode in the past year, parental education, and household income. Model 3 additionally included the Picture Vocabulary score, a measure of receptive language and crystallized cognition. RESULTS: Having T2D was significantly associated with lower fluid cognitive scores before adjustment for confounders (model 1; P {$<$} 0.001). This association was attenuated to nonsignificance with the addition of a priori confounders (model 2; P = 0.06) and Picture Vocabulary scores (model 3; P = 0.49). Receptive language, waist-to-height ratio, and depressive symptoms remained significant in the final model (P {$<$} 0.01 for all, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that while youth with T2D have worse fluid cognition than youth with T1D, these differences are accounted for by differences in crystallized cognition (receptive language), central adiposity, and mental health. These potentially modifiable factors are also independently associated with fluid cognitive health, regardless of diabetes type. Future studies of cognitive health in people with youth-onset diabetes should focus on investigating these significant factors.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is a presumption that hospital readmission rates amongst persons aged {$>$}/=65 years are mainly dependent on the quality of care. In this study, our primary aim was to explore the association between 30-day hospital readmission for patients aged {$>$}/=65 years and socioeconomic characteristics of the studied population. A secondary aim was to explore the association between self-reported lack of strategies for working with older patients at primary health care centres and early readmission. DESIGN: A cross-sectional ecological study and an online questionnaire sent to the heads of the primary health care centres. We performed correlation and regression analyses. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Register data of 283,063 patients in 29 primary health care centres in the Region Orebro County (Sweden) in 2014. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Thirty-day hospital readmission rates for patients aged {$>$}/=65 years. Covariates were socioeconomic characteristics among patients registered at the primary health care centre and eldercare workload. RESULTS: Early hospital readmission was found to be associated with low socioeconomic status of the studied population: proportion foreign-born (r = 0.74; p {$<$} 0.001), proportion unemployed (r = 0.73; p {$<$} 0.001), Care Need Index (r = 0.74; p {$<$} 0.001), sick leave rate (r = 0.51; p {$<$} 0.01) and average income (r = -0.40; p = 0.03). The proportion of unemployed alone could explain up to 71.4\% of the variability in hospital readmission (p {$<$} 0.001). Primary health care centres reporting lack of strategies to prevent readmissions in older patients did not have higher hospital readmission rates than those reporting they had such strategies. CONCLUSION: Primary health care centres localized in neighbourhoods with low socioeconomic status had higher rates of hospital readmission for patients aged {$>$}/=65. Interventions aimed at reducing hospital readmissions for older patients should also consider socioeconomic disparities. Key Points In Sweden, hospital readmission within 30 days among patients aged {$>$}/=65 has been used as a measure of quality of primary care for the elderly. However, in our study, elderly 30-day readmission was associated with low neighbourhood socioeconomic status. A simple survey in one Swedish region showed that the primary health care centres that lacked active strategies for working with aged patients did not have higher hospital readmission rates than those that reported having strategies. Interventions aimed at reducing elderly hospital readmissions should therefore also consider the socioeconomic disparities in the elderly.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Adequate health literacy is important for patients to manage chronic diseases and medications. We examined the association between health literacy and multiple medications in community-dwelling adults aged 50 years and older in England. DESIGN, SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: We included 6368 community-dwelling people of median age 66 years from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Health literacy was assessed at wave 5 (2010/11) with 4 questions concerning a medication label. Four correct answers were categorised as adequate health literacy, otherwise low. Data on medications were collected at wave 6 (2012/13). To examine the difference in the number of medications between low and adequate health literacy, we used zero-inflated negative binomial regression, estimating odds ratio (OR) for zero medication and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for the number of medications, with 95\% CIs. Associations were adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic and health characteristics, smoking and cognitive function. We also stratified the analysis by sex, and age (50-64 and {$\geq$}65 years). To be comparable with preceding studies, multinomial regression was fitted using commonly used thresholds of polypharmacy (0 vs 1-4, 5-9, {$\geq$}10 medications). RESULTS: Although low health literacy was associated with a lower likelihood of being medication-free (OR=0.64, 95\% CI: 0.45 to 0.91), health literacy was not associated with the number of medications among those at risk for medication (IRR=1.01, 95\% CI: 0.96 to 1.05), and this finding did not differ among younger and older age groups or women. Among men, low health literacy showed a weak association (IRR=1.06, 95\% CI: 0.99 to 1.14). Multinomial regression models showed graded risks of polypharmacy for low health literacy. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no overall association between health literacy and the number of medications, this study does not support the assertion that low health literacy is associated with a notably higher number of medications in men.},

  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of health belief model-based health education intervention in improving blood pressure control of patients with hypertension in community settings. Methods: From September 2016 to September 2017, 400 newly diagnosed patients with hypertension were recruited from 6 community healthcare centers with comparable population size and health services in the Shunyi District of Beijing. All community healthcare centers were randomly assigned to the intervention group (206 patients) and the control group (194 patients). Patients in the intervention group received 3 lectures (20-30 min for each) of health belief model-based health education. Patients in the control group received usual care. The basic characteristics, health beliefs, and health literacy were collected, and blood pressure was measured before and after the intervention, respectively. The difference-in-difference model was used to analyze the change of blood pressure and the influencing factors between two groups before and after the intervention. Results: A total of 134 patients in the intervention group and 129 patients in the control group completed the study. After adjusting for the age, gender, family income, medical insurance, chronic diseases and family history, the score of perceived barriers was increased by 1.65 (P=0.016), and perceived seriousness was decreased by 0.73 (P=0.018). The systolic blood pressure of patients was decreased by 7.37 mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa, P=0.001) and diastolic blood pressure was decreased by 4.07 mmHg (P=0.014), respectively. The {$\beta$} (95\%CI) values were -7.37 (-11.88,-2.86) and -4.07 (-7.30, -0.84). The perceived susceptibility and self-efficacy had a significant influence on the blood pressure of patients (P{$<$}0.05). Conclusion: Health belief model-based health education intervention could significantly improve the blood pressure control of patients with hypertension in the community settings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), due to their long term, multi-drug exposure and their side effects, non-adherence to therapy is common and is associated with adverse clinical outcome. In this study, we aimed to evaluate and compare medication adherence in patients with SLE and RA considering their psychosocial factors, health literacy, and current life concerns. METHODS: 88 patients fulfilled the criteria of RA(N:46) and SLE(N:42);using disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or immunosuppressive, we evaluated, their demographic data, co-morbid diseases, the number of medications, estimated income, having health insurance, family size and disease poor prognostic factors. The 8-item Morisky's Medication Adherence, Depression by Beck depression inventory (21 Q), and drug literacy level were used. RESULTS: Medication non-adherence was seen in 91.3\% of the RA group and 90.4\% of the SLE group. Moderate to very severe depression was seen in [21 (45.7\%)] and [12 (25.9\%)] of the RA and SLE patients, respectively. In the SLE group, depression and having poor prognostic factors, and in the RA group, depression, having co-morbid diseases and higher pill numbershad a significant effect on medication adherence. CONCLUSION: There was a high prevalence of drug non-adherence in our RA and SLE patients. The most prevalent factor in non-adherence in both groups was depression. After that, in RA patients the presence of co-morbid disease and in SLE patients the presence of poor prognostic factors were related to non-adherence. Factors like income, health insurance, disease duration, and health literacy had no significant effect on medication adherence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Discharge planning is a routine feature of health systems in many countries. The aim of discharge planning is to reduce hospital length of stay and unplanned readmission to hospital, and improve the co-ordination of services following discharge from hospital. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of planning the discharge of individual patients moving from hospital. SEARCH METHODS: We updated the review using the Cochrane EPOC Group Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Social Science Citation Index (last searched in March 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared an individualised discharge plan with routine discharge care that was not tailored to the individual patient. Participants were hospital inpatients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently undertook data analysis and quality assessment using a pre designed data extraction sheet. Studies are grouped according to patient group (elderly medical patients, patients recovering from surgery and those with a mix of conditions) and by outcome. Our statistical analysis was done on an intention to treat basis, we calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous data using fixed-effect meta-analysis. When combining outcome data was not possible, because of differences in the reporting of outcomes, we have presented the data in narrative summary tables. MAIN RESULTS: We included twenty-four RCTs (8098 patients); three RCTS were identified in this update. Sixteen studies recruited older patients with a medical condition, four recruited patients with a mix of medical and surgical conditions, one recruited patients from a psychiatric hospital, one from both a psychiatric hospital and from a general hospital, and two trials patients admitted to hospital following a fall (110 patients). Hospital length of stay and readmissions to hospital were statistically significantly reduced for patients admitted to hospital with a medical diagnosis and who were allocated to discharge planning (mean difference length of stay -0.91, 95\% CI -1.55 to -0.27, 10 trials; readmission rates RR 0.82, 95\% CI 0.73 to 0.92, 12 trials). For elderly patients with a medical condition there was no statistically significant difference between groups for mortality (RR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.78 to 1.25, five trials) or being discharged from hospital to home (RR 1.03, 95\% CI 0.93 to 1.14, two trials). This was also the case for trials recruiting patients recovering from surgery and a mix of medical and surgical conditions. In three trials, patients allocated to discharge planning reported increased satisfaction. There was little evidence on overall healthcare costs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence suggests that a discharge plan tailored to the individual patient probably brings about reductions in hospital length of stay and readmission rates for older people admitted to hospital with a medical condition. The impact of discharge planning on mortality, health outcomes and cost remains uncertain.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is the major cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity, especially in low and middle-income countries. Continuous monitoring  of pathogens and their antibiotic resistance pattern is crucial for managing  neonatal sepsis. This study aimed to determine neonatal sepsis due to bacteria,  antibiotic resistance patterns, associated risk factors and patient outcomes at  St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College. METHOD: An institutional-based  cross-sectional study was conducted on 400 neonates suspected of sepsis at St.  Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College from March 2020 to July 2020. A  questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic information, clinical  parameters and potential risk factors from study participants. About 2ml of blood  was drawn aseptically and inoculated into Tryptone Soya Broth at the patient's  bedside. Bacterial identification was performed by using standard microbiological  techniques. The disk diffusion method was used to determine the antibiotic  susceptibility patterns of each isolated bacteria. Data entry and analysis were  done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 software.  Bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess associated  risk factors of neonatal sepsis. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered  statically significant with a 95\% confidence interval. RESULTS: The overall  prevalence of neonatal septicemia was 21\% (84/400). Of these, 67 (79.8\%) and 17  (20.2\%) were gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, respectively. Klebsiella  spp, 37 (44\%), E. coli 19 (21.6\%) and Coagulase negative Staphylococci 13  (15.47\%) were the leading cause of neonatal sepsis. Ciprofloxacin and amikacin  were the most effective antibiotics for gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.  Multidrug resistance was observed in 84\% of the bacterial isolates. Low birth  weight and preterm were associated with neonatal septicemia (AOR\,=\,49.90, 95\%  CI\,=\,15.14-123.081, P\,=\,0.002) and (AOR\,=\,18.20, 95\% CI\,=\,6.835-27.541,  P\,=\,0.004) respectively. CONCLUSION: Klebsiella spp and E. coli were frequently  isolated bacteria in our study. The proportion of multidrug-resistance was  significantly high. Most isolated bacteria were resistant to ampicillin,  ceftazidime, cefotaxime and gentamycin, which indicates the necessity of  continuous evaluation of antibiotic resistance rate.},

DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis. Randomized controlled trials that compared fall rates in older people who undertook exercise programs with fall rates in those who did not exercise were included. SETTING: Older people. PARTICIPANTS: General community and residential care. MEASUREMENTS: Fall rates. RESULTS: The pooled estimate of the effect of exercise was that it reduced the rate of falling by 17\% (44 trials with 9,603 participants, rate ratio (RR)=0.83, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=0.75-0.91, P{$<$}.001, I(2)=62\%). The greatest relative effects of exercise on fall rates (RR=0.58, 95\% CI=0.48-0.69, 68\% of between-study variability explained) were seen in programs that included a combination of a higher total dose of exercise ({$>$}50 hours over the trial period) and challenging balance exercises (exercises conducted while standing in which people aimed to stand with their feet closer together or on one leg, minimize use of their hands to assist, and practice controlled movements of the center of mass) and did not include a walking program. CONCLUSION: Exercise can prevent falls in older people. Greater relative effects are seen in programs that include exercises that challenge balance, use a higher dose of exercise, and do not include a walking program. Service providers can use these findings to design and implement exercise programs for falls prevention.},

  abstract = {Low health literacy is associated with poor clinical outcomes. The relationship between literacy and blood pressure (BP) has been inconsistent. We investigated the determinants of health literacy and the potential relationship between health literacy and hypertension management. We conducted a retrospective cohort trial of 360 hypertensive patients. Scale measurements, physical examination, and laboratory tests were performed based on a standard protocol. To determine factors associated with health literacy, multiple logistic regression analysis was performed and the discriminatory power of the scale score for hypertension control was assessed by the area under the receiver operating curve. After adjusting for potential confounders, our findings show that the level of education, home blood pressure measurement, regular medication, and systolic blood pressure are significantly associated with health literacy. Moreover, patients with high health literacy have better hypertension control, a lower risk of ischemic cardiovascular disease (ICVD), lower brachial~ankle~pulse~wave~velocity values, and better health-related quality of life. In addition, our study also demonstrates that we can identify the health literacy level of hypertensive patients using the Chinese Health Literacy Scale for Hypertension. At a cut-off value of 13.5, we predict that patients will achieve long-term hypertension control. Adequate health literacy is a contributing factor to better blood pressure (BP) control and better perceived quality of life in hypertensive patients. Low health literacy increases the 10-year risk of ICVD and incidence of artery stiffness in hypertensive patients. Improving health literacy should be considered an important part of the management of hypertension.}

In this review, we examine how lifetime stress exposure contributes to elevated disease risk, and explore ongoing measurement and scientific issues related to this topic. To accomplish these goals, we first review existing instruments that have been developed for assessing perceived stress, self-reported life events, interviewer-assessed life stressors, and lifetime stress exposure. Next, we describe laboratory-based tasks that have been used for characterizing individual differences in psychological and biological stress reactivity. These methods have yielded an enormous amount of data showing how life stress influences the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis, and immune system, and how such processes can in turn cause allostatic load and biological embedding of the stress effect at the level of the human brain and genome. At the same time, many critical measurement and scientific issues remain unresolved, and we discuss these topics last while describing some pressing issues and opportunities for future research on stress and health.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic patients persistently seek for health information on the internet for medication information seeking, nutrition, disease management, information regarding disease preventive actions and so on. Consumers ability to search, find, appraise and use health information from the internet is known as eHealth literacy skill. eHealth literacy is a congregate set of six basic skills (traditional literacy, health literacy, information literacy, scientific literacy, media literacy and computer literacy). The aim of this study was to assess eHealth literacy level and associated factors among internet user chronic patients in North-west Ethiopia. METHODS: Institutional based cross-sectional study design was conducted. Stratified sampling technique was used to select 423 study participants among chronic patients. The eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) was used for data collection. The eHEALS is a validated eight-item Likert scaled questionnaire used to asses self-reported capability of eHealth consumers to find, appraise, and use health related information from the internet to solve health problems. Statistical Package for Social science version 20 was used for data entry and further analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between the eHealth literacy skill and associated factors. Significance was obtained at 95\% CI and p\,{$<$}\,0.05. RESULT: In total, 423 study subjects were approached and included in the study from February to May, 2019. The response rate to the survey was 95.3\%. The majority of respondents 268 (66.3\%) were males and mean age was 35.58\,{\textpm}\,14.8\,years. The multivariable logistic regression model indicated that participants with higher education (at least having the diploma) are more likely to possess high eHealth literacy skill with Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 3.48, 95\% CI (1.54, 7.87). similarly, being government employee AOR: 1.71, 95\% CI (1.11, 2.68), being urban resident AOR: 1.37, 95\% CI (0.54, 3.49), perceived good health status AOR: 3.97, 95\% CI (1.38, 11.38), having higher income AOR: 4.44, 95\% CI (1.32, 14.86), Daily internet use AOR: 2.96, 95\% CI (1.08, 6.76), having good knowledge about the availability and importance of online resources AOR: 3.12, 95\% CI (1.61, 5.3), having positive attitude toward online resources AOR: 2.94, 95\% CI (1.07, 3.52) and higher level of computer literacy AOR: 3.81, 95\% CI (2.19, 6.61) were the predictors positively associated with higher eHealth literacy level. CONCLUSION: Besides the mounting indication of efficacy, the present data confirm that internet use and eHealth literacy level of chronic patients in this setting is relatively low which clearly implicate that there is a need to fill the skill gap in eHealth literacy among chronic patients which might help them in finding and evaluating relevant online sources for their health-related decisions.},

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. We enrolled 517 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 73.2 +/- 6.3 years; 410 women). We divided the cohort into two groups, non-frail and any-frail, based on Fried Frailty Index scores. We assessed comprehensive health literacy using a 14-item health literacy scale, and classified the participants as having high or low health literacy. We carried out multivariate logistic regression analysis in which the dependent variable was the presence of non-frailty and the independent variable was the presence of high health literacy. The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, educational history and cognitive function. RESULTS: There were 132 (25.5\%) and 385 (74.5\%) participants in the non-frail and any-frail groups, respectively. The analysis showed that high health literacy was independently associated with the non-frail group (odds ratio 1.64, 95\% confidence interval 1.03-2.61). CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that high health literacy was associated with non-frailty. This result implies that comprehensive health literacy might play a salient role in maintaining good health status in community-dwelling older adults in Japan.

We assessed the accuracy in identifying high BP ({$\geq$}140/90 mmHg) and efficiency (mean BP measures per person in one visit) of a practical BP measurement approach against the research standard. METHODS: We analyzed data from a national survey in India with three BP measurements for each adult participant (N = 372,110). The research standard (referred to as 'standard approach') is measuring three BP and using the mean of the last two. In the practical approach, the first BP reading was used if the measure was {$<$}140/90 mmHg; the second BP was used if the first BP was {$\geq$}140/90 mmHg. If the difference between either the first two systolic or diastolic BPs was {$>$}5 mmHg, then we used the third reading. RESULTS: Prevalence of high BP was 15.5\% and 14.9\% using standard and practical approaches, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, false positive, and false negative rates of the practical approach were 85.4\%, 98.0\%, 11.3\%, and 2.7\% compared to the standard approach. The practical approach was more resource-efficient (mean BPs/person/visit 1.4 versus 3.0 for the standard approach). The practical approach had similar validity, but higher efficiency compared to other internationally recommended BP measurement protocols. CONCLUSION: The practical BP measurement approach has high validity, is simpler and involves a lower measurement burden on health care providers and can improve the utility of BP measurement, hypertension diagnosis, and management in busy primary health care settings.},

Though health literacy is important in medication adherence, the relationship between health literacy and medication adherence remains inconclusive; thus raising the question as to whether health literacy has an amplifying or reducing effect on the relationship between beliefs and adherence. OBJECTIVE: The study examined (1) the association between health literacy, beliefs in medicines, illness perceptions, and medication adherence in individuals with type 2 diabetes and (2) the moderating effects of health literacy (including numeracy and document literacy) on the relationship between illness perceptions, beliefs in medicines, and medication adherence. METHODS: Adults {$\geq$}20 years taking oral diabetes medicines at two family medicine clinics, completed a cross-sectional survey. Participants were assessed on beliefs in medicines, illness perceptions, health literacy, self-efficacy, and medication adherence. Multiple linear regressions examined the effect of health literacy, beliefs and self-efficacy, and the moderator effect of health literacy in the relationship between beliefs and adherence. RESULTS: Of the 174 participants, more than half were women (57.5\%) and white (67.8\%). There was a significant positive association between self-efficacy and adherence ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.486, p\,{$<$}\,.001), and a negative association between threatening illness perceptions and adherence ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.292, p\,{$<$}\,.001). Health literacy had a significant moderator effect on the relationship between adherence and concerns beliefs ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.156, p\,=\,.014) and threatening illness perceptions ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.196, p\,=\,.002). The concern beliefs - adherence association was only significant at marginal and adequate literacy levels. When health literacy was separated into numeracy and document literacy, only numeracy moderated the illness perceptions - adherence relationship ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.149, p\,=\,.038). CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy, especially numeracy, needs to be initially addressed before diabetes adherence interventions that address individual concerns about medicines and threatening illness perceptions can work.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding of risk factors and developing healthy lifestyles is a way of tackling the surging burden of chronic diseases in low-to-middle income countries such as Nepal. Health literacy (HL) has a pivotal role in prevention, adherence to treatment, self-care, and better use of health care; therefore, factors associated with HL need to be studied in the context of Nepal. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the level of HL and explore disease-specific knowledge among patients with chronic diseases. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 426 respondents with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from a tertiary care hospital and primary care clinics using face-to-face interviews. HL was measured using a translated and pretested HL questionnaire (the Europe-Asia Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire). Disease-related knowledge was assessed using a validated questionnaire. KEY RESULTS: The study found that 27\% of the respondents had sufficient HL, 19\% had marginal HL, and 54\% had inadequate HL. Factors associated with inadequate HL included being older and female, and having lower or no education, unemployment or retired status, poverty, and having a history of smoking or a history of consuming alcohol. HL was a strong predictor of knowledge regarding hypertension ({$\beta$} = 0.32; p {$<$} .05), diabetes mellitus ({$\beta$} = 0.41; p {$<$} .05), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({$\beta$} = 0.37; p {$<$} .05) in multiple regression analyses after adjusting for age, gender, education, marriage, family history of disease, attendance at follow-up clinics at recommended intervals, information received regarding disease at clinics, smoking, and alcohol intake. CONCLUSIONS: A sufficient level of HL was uncommon among participants in our study. People with sufficient HL knew significantly more about their diseases or conditions than those with inadequate HL. [HLRP: Health Literacy Research and Practice. 2018;2(4):e221-e230.]. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Very little is known about health literacy in Nepal. We conducted a study to learn how much people in Nepal with hypertension, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease knew about their condition and sought to check its association with health literacy. We found that more than one-half of the participants did not have adequate health literacy levels. Participants who were older, female, uneducated, retired from work, or poor had lower levels of health literacy. We also found that those with high levels of health literacy had better knowledge of their disease. Therefore, we recommend that in Nepal health literacy should be measured for each patient and support regarding management of his or her condition should be provided if necessary.},

In 2010, the PRISCUS list was published, specifically designed for its applicability in the German pharmaceutical market. The aim of this study was to evaluate the PRISCUS list compared to international PIM lists. METHODS: Based on selected PIM lists (PRISCUS, STOPP/START, Beers), the medications of 308~patients at a clinic of geriatric rehabilitation were screened for PIMs. Applying START criteria, omission of indicated drug therapies was detected. RESULTS: Regarding the rate of PIM detection, the PRISCUS list was less sensitive than the application of STOPP criteria. While hospitalized, the mean number of administered PIMs per patient was 1.2 based on STOPP criteria and 0.5 based on the PRISCUS list. The lowest number of PIMs per patient was detected by applying the Beers list (0.4 PIMs). CONCLUSION: The Beers list should not be used in the German pharmaceutical market. The amendment of diagnosis-related STOPP criteria to the PRISCUS list would be useful to significantly advance therapeutic success and drug safety in the elderly.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Family members provide the majority of informal care for older adults in Sweden. Nevertheless, by providing a range of assistance, peers often emerge as a central to counter social isolation among older adults. Therefore, there is a need to know more about what informal care provision by older adults to their peers means for different groups of older adults. AIM: This study investigated the types of informal care and support that older adults provide to their peers in Sweden, and how these types of care and support are associated with demographic characteristics and social isolation. We also compared older adults who provide informal care and support with those who do not. METHOD: For this purpose, we used a national online survey named "Involuntary loneliness among senior citizens" answered by 10,044 older adults enrolled in the Swedish Citizen Panel. We adopted a mixed-method design to analyse the survey data, including free-text options (n~=~2155) and numerical data. Social isolation was assessed using a score built from the social loneliness items of the UCLA Loneliness Scale. RESULTS: In our population, 21.5\% of the older adults were providing informal care and support to their peers. Practical/instrumental help was frequently offered by younger participants ({$<$}75~years), men and respondents who were less socially isolated. On a general level, the factors that were positively associated with giving informal care and support to peers were older age, being male, retired, married/living in a relationship, living in an urban area/big city and exhibiting greater isolation. Focusing specifically on social support shows that older participants ({$>$}80) and those~experiencing less~social isolation (score~{$<~$}24) were more engaged in social activities.~ CONCLUSION: This paper is unique in exploring the informal peer-caregiver's perceptions of isolation. Data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic; this highlights the need to recognise informal care and support between older adults and to acknowledge their contributions as an essential component of Swedish civil society, especially during a societal crisis.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE Performance-measure risk adjustment is of great interest to hospital stakeholders who face substantial financial penalties from readmissions pay-for-performance (P4P) measures. Despite evidence of the association between social determinants of health (SDH) and individual patient readmission risk, the effect of risk adjusting for SDH on readmissions P4P penalties to hospitals is not well understood. OBJECTIVE To determine whether risk adjustment for commonly available SDH measures affects the readmissions-based P4P penalty status of a national cohort of children's hospitals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of 43 free-standing children's hospitals within the Pediatric Health Information System database in the calendar year 2013. We evaluated hospital discharges from 2013 that met criteria for 3M Health Information Systems' potentially preventable readmissions measure for calendar year 2013. The analysis was conducted from July 2015 to August 2015. EXPOSURES Two risk-adjustment models: a baseline model adjusted for severity of illness and an SDH-enhanced model that adjusted for severity of illness and the following 4 SDH variables: race, ethnicity, payer, and median household income for the patient's home zip code. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Change in a hospital's potentially preventable readmissions penalty status (ie, change in whether a hospital exceeded the penalty threshold) using an observed-to-expected potentially preventable readmissions ratio of 1.0 as a penalty threshold. RESULTS For the 179 400 hospital discharges from the 43 hospitals meeting inclusion criteria, median (interquartile range [IQR]) hospital-level percentages for the SDH variables were 39.2\% nonwhite (n = 71 300; IQR, 28.6\%-54.6\%), 17.9\% Hispanic (n = 32 060; IQR, 6.7\%-37.0\%), and 58.7\% publicly insured (n = 106 116; IQR, 50.4\%-67.8\%). The hospital median household income for the patient's home zip code was \$ 40 674 (IQR, \$ 35 912-\$ 46 190). When compared with the baseline model, adjustment for SDH resulted in a change in penalty status for 3 hospitals within the 15-day window (2 were no longer above the penalty threshold and 1 was newly penalized) and 5 hospitals within the 30-day window (3 were no longer above the penalty threshold and 2 were newly penalized). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Risk adjustment for SDH changed hospitals' penalty status on a readmissions-based P4P measure. Without adjusting P4P measures for SDH, hospitals may receive penalties partially related to patient SDH factors beyond the quality of hospital care.},

Low health literacy is one of the social determinants of health associated with cancer-related disparities. Over the past several years, a nonprofit organization, a university, and a cancer center in a major urban environment have developed and implemented health literacy programs within healthcare systems and in the community. Health system personnel received extensive health literacy training to reduce medical jargon and improve their patient education using plain language easy-to-understand written materials and teach-back, and also designed plain language written materials including visuals to provide more culturally and linguistically appropriate health education and enhance web-based information. Several sustainable health system policy changes occurred over time. At the community level, organizational assessments and peer leader training on health literacy have occurred to reduce communication barriers between consumers and providers. Some of these programs have been cancer specific, including consumer education in such areas as cervical cancer, skin cancer, and breast cancer that are targeted to early adults across the cancer spectrum from prevention to treatment to survivorship. An example of consumer-driven health education that was tested for health literacy using a comic book-style photonovel on breast cancer with an intergenerational family approach for Chinese Americans is provided. Key lessons learned from the health literacy initiatives and overall conclusions of the health literacy initiatives are also summarized.},

  abstract = {Objective:: To identify how `elderly' patients are defined and considered within Australian clinical guidelines for the use of pharmacotherapy. Method:: Guidelines pertaining to the use of pharmacotherapy, focusing on conditions described in National Health Priority Areas, were identified using databases (Medline, Google Scholar) and organisation websites (Department of Health and Ageing, National Heart Foundation, National Health and Medical Research Council). Guidelines were reviewed and qualitatively analysed to identify any references or definitions of `elderly' persons. Results:: Among the 20 guidelines reviewed, 3 defined `elderly' by chronological age (i.e., years since birth) while the remaining 17 guidelines did not define `elderly' in any way. All 20 guidelines used the term `elderly', whilst some guidelines provided age (chronological)-based dosage recommendations suggesting an ageist or generalist approach in their representation of `elderly', for which rationale was seldom provided. Thematic analysis of the statements revealed five key themes regarding how `elderly' was considered within the guidelines, broadly describing `elderly' persons as being frail and with altered pharmacology. Some guidelines also highlighted the limited evidence base to direct clinical decision-making. A continuum of perceptions of ageing also emerged out of the identified themes. Conclusion:: Clinical practice guidelines currently do not adequately define `elderly' persons and provide limited guidance on how to apply treatment recommendations to older persons. The representation of `elderly' in guidelines needs to be less based on chronological age or generic definitions focusing more on establishing a direct link between an individual patient's characteristics and the pharmacology of their prescribed medication. Clinical guidelines that do not offer any practical descriptions of the features of ageing that are specifically related to the use of pharmacotherapy, or how to assess these in individual patients, render decision-making challenging.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emergence and rapid spread of gram-negative bacteria resistant to carbapenems among newborns is concerning on a global scale. Nonetheless, the  pooled estimate of gram-negative bacteria resistant to carbapenem that cause  neonatal sepsis in developing nations remains unknown. Thus, this study aimed to  determine the combined prevalence of gram-negative bacteria resistant to  carbapenem in African newborns who were suspected of having sepsis. METHODS: All  studies published from January 1, 2010, up to December 30, 2023, from PubMed,  Science Direct, Scopus electronic databases, and the Google Scholar search engine  were researched. Isolates tested for carbapenem from neonates with sepsis,  English language papers conducted in Africa, and cross-sectional and cohort  studies papers were included. Using PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed  and meta-analyzed studies that assessed the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant  gram-negative bacteria. The "Joanna Briggs Institute" was used critically to  evaluate the quality of the included studies. The data analysis was carried out  using STATA™ version 17. Heterogeneity across the studies was evaluated using Q  and I (2) tests. The subgroup analysis was done and, funnel plot and Egger's  regression test were used to detect publication bias. A sensitivity analysis was  conducted. RESULTS: All 36 studies were included in the meta-analysis and  systematic review. The pooled prevalence of carbapenem resistance in Africa was  30.34\% (95\% CI 22.03-38.64\%). The pooled estimate of gram-negative bacteria  resistant to imipenem, and meropenem was 35.57\% (95\% CI 0.67-70.54\%) and 34.35\%  (95\% CI 20.04\% - 48.67\%), respectively. A. baumannii and Pseudomonas spp. had  pooled prevalence of 45.9\% (95\% CI 33.1-58.7\%) and 43.0\% (95\% CI 23.0-62.4\%),  respectively. Similarly, Pseudomonas spp. and A. baumannii also exhibited strong  meropenem resistance, with a pooled prevalence of 29.2\% (95\% CI 4.8-53.5\%) and  36.7\% (95\% CI 20.1-53.3\%), respectively. E. coli and K. pneumoniae were the two  most common isolates. CONCLUSION: There should be urgent antimicrobial  stewardship practices, strengthened surveillance systems and effective treatment  for neonates with sepsis. There was remarkable variation in resistance across the  continent.},

  abstract = {A popular way to control for confounding in observational studies is to identify clusters of individuals (e.g., twin pairs), such that a large set of potential confounders are constant (shared) within each cluster. By studying the exposure--outcome association within clusters, we are in effect controlling for the whole set of shared confounders. An increasingly popular analysis tool is the between--within (BW) model, which decomposes the exposure--outcome association into a `within-cluster effect' and a `between-cluster effect'. BW models are relatively common for nonsurvival outcomes and have been studied in the theoretical literature. Although it is straightforward to use BW models for survival outcomes, this has rarely been carried out in practice, and such models have not been studied in the theoretical literature. In this paper, we propose a gamma BW model for survival outcomes. We compare the properties of this model with the more standard stratified Cox regression model and use the proposed model to analyze data from a twin study of obesity and mortality. We find the following: (i) the gamma BW model often produces a more powerful test of the `within-cluster effect' than stratified Cox regression; and (ii) the gamma BW model is robust against model misspecification, although there are situations where it could give biased estimates.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Although the elderly have a substantially higher drug use than younger patients, even after adjustment for multimorbidity, there is limited knowledge about the elderly's indication for treatment. It is essential for elderly patients to have a well-planned drug therapy. The first step towards a correct and safe drug therapy is to ensure that the patient's drugs have an indication, i.e. correct diagnoses are linked to all of the prescription drugs. The aim of this study was to examine to what extent elderly patients have indication for a number of their prescribed drugs and, furthermore, if there are any differences in indication for treatment depending on gender, age, level of multimorbidity and income. METHOD Data were collected on individuals aged 65~years or older in {\"O}sterg{\"o}tland County in Sweden. To estimate the individual level of multimorbidity the Johns Hopkins ACG Case-Mix System was used. A report from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare was used to identify prescription drugs, for which it is important to have a correct diagnosis. The proportions of patients having indication for these prescription drugs were calculated. Odds ratios of having indication for treatment depending on gender, age, multimorbidity level and income were calculated. RESULTS On average 45.1~\% (range 12.9~\% - 75.8~\%) of the patients' prescribed drugs had indication. Proton pump inhibitors were associated with the lowest level of indication (12.9~\%) and digoxin was associated with the highest level of indication for treatment (75.8~\%). Patients aged 80~years or older had the lowest odds ratios of having indication for treatment. CONCLUSION On average, there was indication for treatment in less than half of the prescription drugs studied. The quality was highest in relation to multimorbidity and lowest in relation to age. The result may to some extent be explained by substandard registration of diagnoses. Since lack of quality of prescription drug use is highly associated with inconvenience among the elderly, as well as high costs to society, it is important that future research and allocation of resources focus on the quality of elderly patients' drug therapy.}

  abstract = {This study sought to analyse antimicrobial pressure, indications for treatment, and compliance with treatment recommendations and to identify possible problem areas where inappropriate use could be improved through interventions by the network of the local Swedish Strategic Programme Against Antibiotic Resistance (Strama) groups. Five point-prevalence surveys were performed in between 49 and 72 participating hospitals from 2003 to 2010. Treatments were recorded for 19 predefined diagnosis groups and whether they were for community-acquired infection, hospital-acquired infection, or prophylaxis. Approximately one-third of inpatients were treated with antimicrobials. Compliance with guidelines for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia with narrow-spectrum penicillin was 17.0\% during baseline 2003-2004, and significantly improved to 24.2\% in 2010. Corresponding figures for quinolone use in uncomplicated cystitis in women were 28.5\% in 2003-2004, and significantly improved, decreasing to 15.3\% in 2010. The length of surgical prophylaxis improved significantly when data for a single dose and 1 day were combined, from 56.3\% in 2003-2004 to 66.6\% in 2010. Improved compliance was possibly the effect of active local feedback, repeated surveys, and increasing awareness of antimicrobial resistance. Strama groups are important for successful local implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs in Sweden.},

  abstract = {Multimorbidity (two or more coexisting conditions in an individual) is a growing global challenge with substantial effects on individuals, carers and society. Multimorbidity occurs a decade earlier in socioeconomically deprived communities and is associated with premature death, poorer function and quality of life and increased health-care utilization. Mechanisms underlying the development of multimorbidity are complex, interrelated and multilevel, but are related to ageing and underlying biological mechanisms and broader determinants of health such as socioeconomic deprivation. Little is known about prevention of multimorbidity, but focusing on psychosocial and behavioural factors, particularly population level interventions and structural changes, is likely to be beneficial. Most clinical practice guidelines and health-care training and delivery focus on single diseases, leading to care that is sometimes inadequate and potentially harmful. Multimorbidity requires person-centred care, prioritizing what matters most to the individual and the individual's carers, ensuring care that is effectively coordinated and minimally disruptive, and aligns with the patient's values. Interventions are likely to be complex and multifaceted. Although an increasing number of studies have examined multimorbidity interventions, there is still limited evidence to support any approach. Greater investment in multimorbidity research and training along with reconfiguration of health care supporting the management of multimorbidity is urgently needed.},

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing Wave 6 (2012--2013). Participants: 7730 participants aged over 50\,years. Data synthesis: Two multivariate models were created. HR with corresponding 95\% CI, for polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy, were calculated after adjusting for gender, age, wealth, smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, self-rated health and the presence of a chronic health condition. Results: Lower wealth (lowest wealth quintile vs highest wealth quintile, adjusted HR 1.28; 95\%\,CI 1.04 to 1.69, P=0.02) and obesity (adjusted HR 1.81; 95\%\,CI 1.53 to 2.15, p{$<$}0.01) were significantly associated with polypharmacy. Increasing age (50--59\,years vs 70--79\,years, adjusted HR 3.42; 95\%\,CI 2.81 to 4.77, p{$<$}0.01) and the presence of a chronic health condition (adjusted HR 2.94; 95\%\,CI 2.55 to 3.39, p{$<$}0.01) were also associated with polypharmacy. No statistically significant association between smoking and polypharmacy (adjusted HR 1.06; 95\%\,CI 0.86 to 1.29, P=0.56) was established; while, very frequent alcohol consumption (consuming alcohol {$>$}5\,times per week) was inversely associated with polypharmacy (never drank alcohol vs very frequently, adjusted HR 0.64; 95\%\,CI 0.52 to 0.78, p{$<$}0.01). The adjusted HR for hyperpolypharmacy was accentuated, compared with polypharmacy. Conclusion: This study has identified that lower wealth, obesity, increasing age and chronic health conditions are significantly associated with polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy prevalence. The effect of these factors, on polypharmacy and especially hyperpolypharmacy prevalence, is likely to become more pronounced with the widening gap in UK wealth inequalities, the current obesity epidemic and the growing population of older people. The alcohol findings contribute to the debate on the relationship between alcohol consumption and health.},

We examine frailty, energy and macronutrient intake, biomarkers of nutritional status, and food insufficiency in US older adult (age {$\geq$}60 years) participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n=4731). Frailty was defined as meeting {$\geq$}2 and pre-frailty as meeting 1 of the following 4 item criteria: 1) slow walking; 2) muscular weakness; 3) exhaustion, and 4) low physical activity. Intake was assessed by 24-hour dietary recall. Food insufficiency was self-reported as ``sometimes'' or ``often'' not having enough food to eat. Analyses adjusted for gender, race, age, smoking, education, income, BMI, other comorbid conditions, and complex survey design. Prevalence of frailty was highest among people who were obese (20.8\%), followed by overweight (18.4\%), normal weight (16.1\%), and lowest among people who were underweight (13.8\%). Independent of BMI, daily energy intake was lowest in people who were frail, followed by pre-frail, and highest in people who were not frail (mean kJ {\textpm} SE: 6648{\textpm}130, 6966{\textpm}79, 7280{\textpm}84, respectively, p{$<$}0.01). Energy adjusted macronutrient intakes were similar in people with and without frailty. Frail (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)= 4.7, 95\% CI 1.7-12.7) and pre-frail (AOR=2.1, 95\% CI 0.8-5.8) people were more likely to report being food insufficient than not frail people. Serum albumin, carotenoids, and selenium levels were lower in frail adults than not frail adults. Research is needed on targeted interventions to improve nutritional status and food insufficiency among frail older adults, while not necessarily increasing BMI.},

We use the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS), a nationally representative survey of Mexicans age 50 and older, to investigate the linkages between three indicators of SES (education, income, and wealth) and a set of health outcomes and behaviors in more and less urban areas of Mexico. We consider three measures of current health (self-rated health and two measures of physical functioning) and three behavioral indicators (obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption). In urban areas, we find patterns similar to those in industrialized countries: higher SES individuals are more likely to report better health than their lower SES counterparts, regardless of the SES measure considered. In contrast, we find few significant SES-health associations in less urban areas. The results for health behaviors are generally similar between the two areas of residence. One exception is the education-obesity relationship. Our results suggest that education is a protective factor for obesity in urban areas and a risk factor in less urban areas. Contrary to patterns in the industrialized world, income is associated with higher rates of obesity, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption. We also evaluate age and sex differences in the SES-health relationship among older Mexicans. The results suggest that further economic development in Mexico may lead to a widening of socioeconomic inequalities in health. The study also provides insight into why socioeconomic gradients in health are weak among Mexican-Americans and underscores the importance of understanding health inequalities in Latin America for research on Hispanic health patterns in the US.},

  abstract = {[People are interconnected, and so their health is interconnected. In recognition of this social fact, there has been growing conceptual and empirical attention over the past decade to the impact of social networks on health. This article reviews prominent findings from this literature. After drawing a distinction between social network studies and social support studies, we explore current research on dyadic and supradyadic network influences on health, highlighting findings from both egocentric and sociocentric analyses. We then discuss the policy implications of this body of work, as well as future research directions. We conclude that the existence of social networks means that people's health is interdependent and that health and health care can transcend the individual in ways that patients, doctors, policy makers, and researchers should care about.]}

  abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second largest cause of cancer death in the UK. Since 2010, CRC screening based on Faecal Occult Blood testing has been offered by the NHS in England biennially to all persons age 60-69 years. Several studies have demonstrated a gradient in uptake using area-level markers of socio-economic status (SES), but few have examined the individual-level contributors to the gradient. We aimed to quantify the extent of SES inequality in CRC screening uptake in England using individual-level data, and to identify individual factors associated with this inequality. We used data from 1833 participants (aged 61-69) in Wave 5 (collected in years 2010/11) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) eligible for having been sent at least one CRC screening invitation. Uptake was defined by self-report of ever having been screened as part of the National Screening Programme. We assessed socio-economic inequality using the corrected concentration index of uptake against SES rank, which was derived by regressing a range of SES markers against net non-pension household wealth. Other demographic and health-related variables were included in the analysis. Factors associated with inequality were measured using concentration index decomposition. There was a significant pro-rich gradient in screening uptake (concentration index: 0.16, 95\% CI:0.11-0.22), mostly explained within our model by differences in non-pension wealth (38.7\%), partner screening status (15.9\%), sickness/disability (13.5\%), and health literacy (8.5\%). Interventions aimed at reducing inequalities in CRC screening uptake should focus on improving acceptability of screening in populations with low levels of education and literacy barriers.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Newborn sepsis accounts for more than a third of neonatal deaths globally and one in five neonatal deaths in Ethiopia. The first-line treatment  recommended by WHO is the combination of gentamicin with ampicillin or  benzylpenicillin. Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) are increasingly resistant to  previously effective antibiotics. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to estimate the  prevalence of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteremia and identify risk  factors for antibiotic resistance, among newborns with GNB sepsis. METHODS: At a  tertiary hospital in Ethiopia, we enrolled a cohort pregnant women and their  newborns, between March and December 2017. Newborns who were followed up until 60  days of life for clinical signs of sepsis. Among the newborns with clinical signs  of sepsis, blood samples were cultured; bacterial species were identified and  tested for antibiotic susceptibility. We described the prevalence of antibiotic  resistance, identified newborn, maternal, and environmental factors associated  with multidrug resistance (MDR), and combined resistance to ampicillin and  gentamicin (AmpGen), using multivariable regression. RESULTS: Of the 119 newborns  with gram-negative bacteremia, 80 (67\%) were born preterm and 82 (70\%) had  early-onset sepsis. The most prevalent gram-negative species were Klebsiella  pneumoniae 94 (79\%) followed by Escherichia coli 10 (8\%). Ampicillin resistance  was found in 113 cases (95\%), cefotaxime 104 (87\%), gentamicin 101 (85\%), AmpGen  101 (85\%), piperacillin-tazobactam 47 (39\%), amikacin 10 (8.4\%), and Imipenem 1  (0.8\%). Prevalence of MDR was 88\% (n = 105). Low birthweight and late-onset  sepsis (LOS) were associated with higher risks of AmpGen-resistant infections.  All-cause mortality was higher among newborns treated with ineffective  antibiotics. CONCLUSION: There was significant resistance to current first-line  antibiotics and cephalosporins. Additional data are needed from primary care and  community settings. Amikacin and piperacillin-tazobactam had lower rates of  resistance; however, context-specific assessments of their potential adverse  effects, their local availability, and cost-effectiveness would be necessary  before selecting a new first-line regimen to help guide clinical decision-making.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To perform a qualitative systematic overview of the measurement properties of the most commonly utilized walk tests in the cardiorespiratory domain: the 2-min walk test (2MWT), 6-min walk test (6MWT), 12-min walk test (12MWT), self-paced walk test (SPWT), and shuttle walk test (SWT). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1966 to January 2000) and CINAHL (1982 to December 1999) electronic databases were searched. Bibliographies of the retrieved articles were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical trials and observational studies were included if they reported data on the validity, reliability, interpretability, or responsiveness of the 2MWT, 6MWT, 12MWT, SPWT, or SWT. Only studies conducted on patients with cardiac and/or respiratory involvement were included. RESULTS: Fifty-two studies examining measurement properties of the various walk tests were found: 5 studies on the 2MWT, 29 studies on the 6MWT, 13 studies on the 12MWT, 6 studies on the SPWT, and 4 studies on the SWT. Measurement properties were most strongly demonstrated for the 6MWT. Correlations of 6MWT distance and maximal oxygen consumption ranged from 0.51 to 0.90. A change in distance walked of at least 54 m was found to be clinically significant for the 6MWT. Reliability was shown to be optimized when the administration of walk tests was standardized and at least two practice walks were performed. Patients with increased likelihood of postoperative complications, hospitalization, and death were identified by analysis of distance walked. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement properties of the 6MWT have been the most extensively researched and established. In addition, the 6MWT is easy to administer, better tolerated, and more reflective of activities of daily living than the other walk tests. Therefore, the 6MWT is currently the test of choice when using a functional walk test for clinical or research purposes.},

SETTING: The National Population Health Survey of Canada, with frailty estimated at baseline (1994/95) and mortality follow-up to 2004/05. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults (N=2,740, 60.8\% women) aged 65 to 102 from 10 Canadian provinces. During the 10-year follow-up, 1,208 died. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported health information was used to construct a frailty index (Frailty Index) as a proportion of deficits accumulated in individuals. The main outcome measure was mortality. RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty increased with age in men and women (correlation coefficient=0.955-0.994, P{$<$}.001). The Frailty Index estimated that 622 (22.7\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=21.0-24.4\%) of the sample was frail. Frailty was more common in women (25.3\%, 95\% CI=23.2-27.5\%) than in men (18.6\%, 95\% CI=15.9-21.3\%). For those aged 85 and older, the Frailty Index identified 39.1\% (95\% CI=31.3-46.9\%) of men as frail, compared with 45.1\% (95\% CI=39.7-50.5\%) of women. Frailty significantly increased the risk of death, with an age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio for the Frailty Index of 1.57 (95\% CI=1.41-1.74). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of frailty increases with age and at any age lessens survival. The Frailty Index approach readily identifies frail people at risk of death, presumably because of its use of multiple health deficits in multidimensional domains.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health literacy deficits affect half of the US overall patient population, especially the elderly, and are linked to poor health outcomes among noncancer patients. Yet little is known about how health literacy affects cancer populations. The authors examined the relation between health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and health literacy among men with prostate cancer. METHODS: Data analysis included 1581 men with newly diagnosed clinically localized prostate cancer from a population-based study, the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP). Participants completed assessment of health literacy using Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and HRQOL using the Short Form-12 General Health Survey (SF12). Bivariate and multivariate regression was used to determine the potential association between REALM and HRQOL, while controlling for sociodemographic and illness-related variables. RESULTS: Higher health literacy level was significantly associated with better mental well-being (SF12-Mental Component Summary [MCS]; P {$<$} .001) and physical well-being (SF12-Physical Component Summary [PCS]; P {$<$} .001) in bivariate analyses. After controlling for sociodemographic (age, marital status, race, income, and education) and illness-related factors (types of cancer treatment, tumor aggressiveness, and comorbidities), health literacy remained significantly associated with SF12-MCS scores (P {$<$} .05) but not with SF12-PCS scores. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer, those with low health literacy levels were more vulnerable to mental distress than those with higher health literacy levels, but physical well-being was no different. These findings suggest that health literacy may be important in patients managing prostate cancer and the effects of treatment, and provide the hypothesis that supportive interventions targeting patients with lower health literacy may improve their HRQOL.},

The internal consistency and the coefficient of scalability were well above the acceptance level, which indicated an internal reliability and validity of the new scale. The frequency of personal and home-assistance care, type of accommodation, self-assessment of self-care and domestic activities were compared with the level of dependence in ADL and indicated external validity.

  abstract = {Ability in activities of daily living (ADL), use of assistive devices, and relation to functional limitations and impairments were studied among persons between 70 and 76 years of age within the Inter-Vention study of Elderly in G{\"o}teborg (IVEG) Sweden. An ADL index was developed including instrumental activities (I-ADLs) (cleaning, shopping, transportation and cooking), which was combined with Katz' Index of personal daily life activities (P-ADLs) (bathing, dressing, going to the toilet, transfer, continence and feeding). Independence of and dependence on assistance from another person was assessed and it was possible to classify performance according to an ordinal scale of ADL-steps. The reliability and validity of the scale were tested in an out-patient sample (n = 85) as well as in a population of 76-year-olds (n = 659) and were found to be sufficient (coefficients of reproducibility and scalability, internal consistency, inter- observer reliability, content, construct, and criterion validity). The "Staircase of ADL" can be used for observation and documentation of different levels of ability/disability for individuals, groups and for population studies. Most persons (83\%) were independent in all activities at age 70 (n = 617). Among survivors followed longitudinally, the incidence of disability was 8\% between 70 and 73 and 26\% between 73 and 76 years of age. Dependence at age 70 could predict mortality as well as institutionalization. No sex differences were found in the proportion with overall disability. Assistance given by relatives dominated both at 70, 73 and 76 years of age. One fifth at age 70 and almost half of the population at age 76 used assistive devices (AD) in daily life activities, and the use was more frequent in women (52\%) than men (37\%) at age 76 (n = 595). During the studied age interval, 39\% "new users" were found, while 22\% were "temporary users". The usage rate was high and the effectiveness of ADs increased the person's ability to master the situation, especially evident as increased safety and reduction of effort in activities of daily living, implying a reduced degree of handicap. Physical impairments and functional limitations had a considerable impact on dependence in daily life activities as persons dependent in ADL had lower maximal walking speed, grip strength, knee extensor strength, stair-climbing capacity and forward reach than those who were independent in ADL (n = 602). Walking speed in both women and men and sight impairment in men had the greatest influence on dependence in ADL. Women and men who stayed independent over the period (70-76) had significantly higher maximal walking speed and knee extensor strength at the age of 70 than those who became dependent or were dependent on both occasions.},

  abstract = {Background: Health literacy concerns the capacities of people to meet the complex demands of health in modern society. In spite of the growing attention for the concept among European health policymakers, researchers and practitioners, information about the status of health literacy in Europe remains scarce. This article presents selected findings from the first European comparative survey on health literacy in populations. Methods: The European health literacy survey (HLS-EU) was conducted in eight countries: Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain (n = 1000 per country, n = 8000 total sample). Data collection was based on Eurobarometer standards and the implementation of the HLS-EU-Q (questionnaire) in computer-assisted or paper-assisted personal interviews. Results: The HLS-EU-Q constructed four levels of health literacy: insufficient, problematic, sufficient and excellent. At least 1 in 10 (12\%) respondents showed insufficient health literacy and almost 1 in 2 (47\%) had limited (insufficient or problematic) health literacy. However, the distribution of levels differed substantially across countries (29--62\%). Subgroups within the population, defined by financial deprivation, low social status, low education or old age, had higher proportions of people with limited health literacy, suggesting the presence of a social gradient which was also confirmed by raw bivariate correlations and a multivariate linear regression model. Discussion: Limited health literacy represents an important challenge for health policies and practices across Europe, but to a different degree for different countries. The social gradient in health literacy must be taken into account when developing public health strategies to improve health equity in Europe.},

The  major burden of the problem occurs in the developing world while most evidence is  derived from developed countries. The objective of this study was to evaluate the  epidemiology of neonatal sepsis and associated factors among neonates admitted to  Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). METHODS: Hospital based prospective  cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2016 to May 2017. Neonates with  clinical sepsis were included into the study. Data were analyzed using SPSS  version 20. Frequencies, proportion and summary statistics were used to describe  the study population in relation to relevant variables. Multivariate logistic  regressions were used to assess factors associated with neonatal sepsis. p-values  of {$<$} 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of  901neonates were admitted to NICU of which 303 neonates were admitted with  diagnosis of clinical sepsis making the prevalence of neonatal sepsis to be 34\%.  Bacteremia were confirmed in 88/303(29.3\%) of clinical sepsis, and gram-positive  bacteria constituted 47/88(53.4\%). Of all positive blood cultures, 52/88(59.1\%)  were reported from late onset sepsis. Coagulase negative staphylococcus (CoNS)  accounted for 22/88(25\%) followed by E. coli and S. aureus, each contributing  18/88(20.3\%) and 16/88(18.2\%) respectively. Prolonged PROM, low fifth Apgar  score, prematurity and low birth weight were strongly associated with increased  risk of neonatal sepsis. Neonates born to mothers who received antibiotics during  labor and delivery were at significantly lower risk of acquiring neonatal sepsis.  CONCLUSION: The prevalence of neonatal sepsis was high, and most causes of  neonatal sepsis were gram positive bacteria and most bacteria isolates were from  late onset sepsis. Obstetric factors were strongly associated with development of  neonatal sepsis. Intrapartal antibiotic administration significantly reduces  neonatal sepsis.},

This study investigates Treg immunity in newborns in West Africa, where sepsis  remains a major public health problem. Treg phenotypes on neonates subgroups with  early-onset sepsis (EOS), presumed sepsis, and healthy newborn with and without  prenatal risk factors were evaluated. Treg phenotypes varied according to  prenatal conditions, with increase in Treg frequency and Foxp3 expression in  healthy newborns with prenatal risk factors compared to those with none risk.  Compared to healthy newborns with prenatal risk factors, EOS neonates had a  significantly reduced frequency of Treg and Foxp3 expression. In the Treg pool,  higher frequency of activated Treg was observed in EOS neonates, suggesting an  in-utero activation upstream of the sepsis onset. Their migration to the  infection site may explain the reduced frequency of circulating Integrin {$\alpha$}4{$\beta$}1(+)  Treg suggestive of homing to the endothelial tissue. EOS neonates show increases  expression of CTLA-4, PD-1 and CD39 on Treg, which negatively regulate the  activation of effector T cells (Teff) corroborating by the lower frequency of  Teff in EOS neonates. The higher frequency of CD39(+) Treg and the lower  frequency of integrin{$\alpha$}4{$\beta$}1(+) Treg in EOS non-survivor suggests that Treg  exhaustement and endothelial homing are associated with outcome severity.  Neonates developing EOS are born with an altered Treg phenotypic profile. Treg  expression of CTLA-4, PD-1, CD39, and integrin{$\alpha$}4{$\beta$}1 cell markers can be considered  as early warning or diagnostic markers of EOS.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE. We studied Hispanic/Latina women's satisfaction with care after receiving group or individual educational sessions (vs standard of care) with a promotora before screening mammography. A promotora is a culturally appropriate community health worker for the Hispanic/Latino community. Promotoras have been shown to increase screening mammography rates and follow-up of abnormal mammograms in this population. However, a promotora's impact on elements of patient care and patient satisfaction remains poorly described. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Hispanic/Latina women 40-64 years old were randomized to one of three groups: the control group (standard-of-care well woman screening), an individual educational session with a promotora followed by well woman screening with access to the promotora, or a group educational session followed by well woman screening with access to the promotora. Access to the promotora included the opportunity to ask questions during well woman screening and a follow-up telephone call to discuss results and follow-up if necessary. Participants completed a premammography survey that assessed demographics and health literacy and a postmammography survey that assessed satisfaction with care, interpersonal processes of care, and satisfaction with the promotora. We used multivariable linear regression models and two-sample t tests for continuous outcome measures and a multivariable logistic regression model for dichotomized outcomes. RESULTS. Of the 100 women enrolled in the study, 94 completed well woman screening and the postmammography survey. Hispanic/Latina women with access to the promotora providing educational sessions in either the group (mean satisfaction with care score, 78.1) or individual (mean satisfaction with care score, 78.8) setting reported higher satisfaction with care than those receiving the standard of care (mean satisfaction with care score, 74.9) (p {$<$} 0.05). The odds of highly compassionate care in women receiving educational sessions was increased and was particularly strong for those receiving individual educational sessions compared with standard of care (odds ratio, 4.78 [95\% CI, 1.51-15.13]). We found that increased satisfaction with the promotora was significantly associated with increased satisfaction with care but that group versus individual educational sessions did not significantly impact satisfaction with the promotora. CONCLUSION. Our study findings have important implications as patient navigators and shared decision making become integral to cancer screening. Group educational sessions may offer a method to decrease the time and expense of providing educational services in the cancer screening setting. However, the overall more positive interpersonal experiences suggested in the individual setting suggest that a larger study is warranted to better understand differences between group and individual educational settings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many aspects of microbial dissemination appear to vary with host cholesterol levels. Since neonatal septicemia remains a leading cause of newborn  admissions and mortality in resource-limited settings, the contribution of  abnormal cholesterol levels in maternal and/or newborn blood to the risk of  neonatal septicemia and outcome requires elucidation. We aim to determine a  relationship between maternal serum and neonatal cord blood cholesterol levels  and neonatal septicemia. METHODS: This will be a mother-newborn pair cohort  study. Approximately 353 pregnant women who are eligible and consent to  participate in the study will have blood drawn for a lipid profile. Upon  delivery, we will analyse the cord blood cholesterol of their newborns and follow  them for 28~days to determine whether the infants develop clinical signs and  symptoms suggestive of neonatal septicemia. Relative risk will be used to  determine the association between cholesterol and newborn septicemia. Poisson  regression will be used to estimate the relative risk (with 95\% confidence  intervals) of developing septicemia. DISCUSSION: Findings from our study will  contribute evidence to support the inclusion of lipid profile screening for  pregnant women and newborns. Our study will determine whether newborns with  abnormal cholesterol or those born to mothers with abnormal cholesterol will  require rigorous follow-up in neonatal clinics.},

  abstract = {Background: Isolated systolic hypertension occurs in about 15\% of people aged 60 years or older. In 1989, the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly investigated whether active treatment could reduce cardiovascular complications of isolated systolic hypertension. Fatal and non-fatal stroke combined was the primary endpoint. Methods: All patients ( 60 years) were initially started on masked placebo. At three run-in visits 1 month apart, their average sitting systolic blood pressure was 160--219 mm Hg with a diastolic blood pressure lower than 95 mm Hg. After stratification for centre, sex, and previous cardiovascular complications, 4695 patients were randomly assigned to nitrendipine 10--40 mg daily, with the possible addition of enalapril 5--20 mg daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12{$\cdot$}5--25{$\cdot$}0 mg daily, or matching placebos. Patients withdrawing from double-blind treatment were still followed up. We compared occurrence of major endpoints by intention to treat.  Findings: At a median of 2 years' follow-up, sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures had fallen by 13 mm Hg and 2 mm Hg in the placebo group (n=2297) and by 23 mm Hg and 7 mm Hg in the active treatment group (n=2398). The between-group differences were systolic 10{$\cdot$}1 mm Hg},

Cognitive impairment and late-life depression are associated with increased risk for subsequent dementia; however, investigations of these phenomena appear to be proceeding along separate tracks. OBJECTIVES AND DATA SOURCE: The National Institute of Mental Health organized the conference "Perspectives on Depression, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Cognitive Decline" to consider how the varied perspectives might be better integrated to examine the associations among depression, mild cognitive impairment, and cognitive decline and to illuminate the common or distinct mechanisms involved in these associations. DATA SYNTHESIS: The following 2 broad questions were addressed: (1) What gaps in our knowledge have the greatest public health significance? (2) Can we more efficiently use our research dollars and participant resources to fill these gaps? Meeting participants included grantees from the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Institute on Aging and program staff from the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute on Aging, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. CONCLUSIONS: One of the most important recommendations to emerge from the meeting discussions is for increased collaboration among clinical and epidemiological investigators whose work focuses in the area of depression with those working primarily in the area of memory disorders. Directions for future research were identified.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the relatively high prevalence of low health literacy among individuals living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), limited empirical attention has been paid to the cognitive and health literacy-related skills that can uniquely influence patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine how health literacy, electronic health (eHealth) literacy, and COPD knowledge are associated with both generic and lung-specific HRQoL in people living with COPD. METHODS: Adults from the COPD Foundation's National Research Registry (n=174) completed a cross-sectional Web-based survey that assessed sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidity status, COPD knowledge, health literacy, eHealth literacy, and generic/lung-specific HRQoL. Hierarchical linear regression models were tested to examine the roles of health literacy and eHealth literacy on generic (model 1) and lung-specific (model 2) HRQoL, after accounting for socioeconomic and comorbidity covariates. Spearman rank correlations examined associations between ordinal HRQoL items and statistically significant hierarchical predictor variables. RESULTS: After adjusting for confounding factors, health literacy, eHealth literacy, and COPD knowledge accounted for an additional 9\% of variance in generic HRQoL (total adjusted R(2)=21\%; F(9,164)=6.09, P{$<$}.001). Health literacy (b=.08, SE 0.02, 95\% CI 0.04-0.12) was the only predictor positively associated with generic HRQoL (P{$<$}.001). Adding health literacy, eHealth literacy, and COPD knowledge as predictors explained an additional 7.40\% of variance in lung-specific HRQoL (total adjusted R(2)=26.4\%; F(8,161)=8.59, P{$<$}.001). Following adjustment for covariates, both health literacy (b=2.63, SE 0.84, 95\% CI 0.96-4.29, P{$<$}.001) and eHealth literacy (b=1.41, SE 0.67, 95\% CI 0.09-2.73, P{$<$}.001) were positively associated with lung-specific HRQoL. Health literacy was positively associated with most lung-specific HRQoL indicators (ie, cough frequency, chest tightness, activity limitation at home, confidence leaving home, sleep quality, and energy level), whereas eHealth literacy was positively associated with 5 of 8 (60\%) lung-specific HRQoL indicators. Upon controlling for confounders, COPD knowledge (b=-.56, SE 0.29, 95\% CI -1.22 to -0.004, P{$<$}.05) was inversely associated with lung-specific HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy, but not eHealth literacy, was positively associated with generic HRQoL. However, both health literacy and eHealth literacy were positively associated with lung-specific HRQoL, with higher COPD knowledge indicative of lower lung-specific HRQoL. These results confirm the importance of considering health and eHealth literacy levels when designing patient education programs for people living with COPD. Future research should explore the impact of delivering interventions aimed at improving eHealth and health literacy among patients with COPD, particularly when disease self-management goals are to enhance HRQoL.},

Informally, the hazard at any given time is the probability of experiencing the event of interest in the next interval among individuals who had not yet experienced the event by the start of the interval. Because the Cox model requires the hazards in both groups to be proportional, researchers are often asked to ``test'' whether hazards are proportional.},

Subjective age is a significant predictor of important health outcomes, but little is known about the criteria by which individuals' subjectively evaluate their age. To identify psychosocial and biomedical factors linked to the subjective evaluation of age, this study examined whether perceived age discrimination and markers of biological aging are associated with subjective age. Participants were 4776 adults (Mage = 68) from the 2008 and 2010 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) who completed measures of subjective age, age discrimination, demographic variables, self-rated health and depression, and had physical health measures, including peak expiratory flow, grip strength, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Telomere length was available for a subset of participants in the 2008 wave (n = 2214). Regression analysis indicated that perceived age discrimination, lower peak expiratory flow, lower grip strength, and higher waist circumference were associated with an older subjective age, controlling for sociodemographic factors, self-rated health, and depression. In contrast, blood pressure and telomere length were not related to subjective age. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that how old a person feels depends in part on psychosocial and biomedical factors, including the experiences of ageism and perceptible indices of fitness and biological age.},

Despite increased attention given to improving the quality and safety of care transitions, little is known about patient and provider perspectives of the transitional care needs of rehospitalized Veterans. As part of a larger quality improvement initiative to reduce hospital readmissions, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 patients and 14 of their interdisciplinary health care providers to better understand their perspectives of the transitional care needs and challenges faced by rehospitalized Veterans. Patients identified 3 common themes that led to rehospitalization: (1) knowledge gaps and deferred power; (2) difficulties navigating the health care system; and (3) complex psychiatric and social needs. Providers identified different themes that led to rehospitalization: (1) substance abuse and mental illness; (2) lack of social or financial support and homelessness; (3) premature discharge and poor communication; and (4) nonadherence with follow-up. Results underscore that rehospitalized Veterans have a complex overlapping profile of real and perceived physical, mental, and social needs. A paradigm of disempowerment and deferred responsibility appears to exist between patients and providers that contributes to ineffective care transitions, resulting in readmissions. These results highlight the cultural constraints on systems of care and suggest that process improvements should focus on increasing the sense of partnership between patients and providers, while simultaneously creating a culture of empowerment, ownership, and engagement, to achieve success in reducing hospital readmissions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numeracy, health literacy, and cognition are important for chronic disease management. Prior studies have found them to be associated with poorer selfcare and worse clinical outcomes, but limited data exists in the context of heart failure (HF), a condition that requires patients to monitor their weight, fluid intake, and dietary salt, especially in the posthospitalization period. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between numeracy, health literacy, and cognition with 30-day readmissions among patients hospitalized for acute decompensated HF (ADHF). DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS: The Vanderbilt Inpatient Cohort Study is a prospective longitudinal study of adults hospitalized with acute coronary syndromes and/or ADHF. We studied 883 adults hospitalized with ADHF. MEASUREMENTS: During their hospitalization, a baseline interview was performed in which demographic characteristics, numeracy, health literacy, and cognition were assessed. Through chart review, clinical characteristics were determined. The outcome of interest was 30-day readmission to any acute care hospital. To examine the association between numeracy, health literacy, cognition, and 30-day readmissions, multivariable Poisson (log-linear) regression was used. RESULTS: Of the 883 patients admitted for ADHF, 23.8\% (n = 210) were readmitted within 30 days; 33.9\% of the study population had inadequate numeracy skills, 24.6\% had inadequate/marginal literacy skills, and 53\% had any cognitive impairment. Numeracy and cognition were not associated with 30-day readmissions. Though (objective) health literacy was associated with 30-day readmissions in unadjusted analyses, it was not in adjusted analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Numeracy, health literacy, and cognition were not associated with 30-day readmission among this sample of patients hospitalized with ADHF.},

  abstract = {An operational definition of frailty is important for clinical care, research, and policy planning. The literature on the clinical definitions, screening tools, and severity measures of frailty were systematically reviewed as part of the Canadian Initiative on Frailty and Aging. Searches of MEDLINE from 1997 to 2009 were conducted, and reference lists of retrieved articles were pearled, to identify articles published in English and French on the identification of frailty in community-dwelling people aged 65 and older. Two independent reviewers extracted descriptive information on study populations, frailty criteria, and outcomes from the selected papers, and quality rankings were assigned. Of 4,334 articles retrieved from the searches and 70 articles retrieved from the pearling, 22 met study inclusion criteria. In the 22 articles, physical function, gait speed, and cognition were the most commonly used identifying components of frailty, and death, disability, and institutionalization were common outcomes. The prevalence of frailty ranged from 5\% to 58\%. Despite significant work over the past decade, a clear consensus definition of frailty does not emerge from the literature. The definition and outcomes that best suit the unique needs of the researchers, clinicians, or policy-makers conducting the screening determine the choice of a screening tool for frailty. Important areas for further research include whether disability should be considered a component or an outcome of frailty. In addition, the role of cognitive and mood elements in the frailty construct requires further clarification.},

Methods and Results- We prospectively studied the long-term effects of a multidisciplinary home-based intervention (HBI) in a cohort of CHF patients randomly allocated to either to HBI (n=149) or usual care (n=148). During a median of 4.2 years of follow-up, there were significantly fewer primary end points (unplanned readmission or death) in the HBI versus usual care group: a mean of 0.21 versus 0.37 primary events per patient per month (P{$<$}0.01). Median event-free survival was more prolonged in the HBI than usual care group (7 versus 3 months; P{$<$}0.01). Fewer HBI patients died (56\% versus 65\%; P=0.06) and had more prolonged survival (a median of 40 versus 22 months; P{$<$}0.05) compared with usual care. Assignment to HBI was both an independent predictor of event-free survival (RR 0.70; P{$<$}0.01) and survival alone (RR 0.72; P{$<$}0.05). Overall, HBI patients had 78 fewer unplanned readmissions compared with usual care (0.17 versus 0.29 readmissions per patient per month; P{$<$}0.05). The median cost of these readmissions was \$A325 versus \$A660/month per HBI and usual care patient (P{$<$}0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effects of HBI in reducing frequency of unplanned readmissions in CHF patients persist in the long term and are associated with prolongation of survival.},

The clinical assessment of the hydration status of an elderly patient is difficult and the elderly care physician relies on both the clinical picture and laboratory investigation.

However, healthy elderly may be able to produce an enhanced vasopressin response to osmotic stimulation compared to their younger counterparts, possibly in response to reduced renal function. The changes in these systems, when combined with coincident disease, place elderly patients at risk of water imbalance and electrolyte disturbance.},

  abstract = {Old age frailty has no consensus definition so far, but it is commonly operationalised as a physical phenotype consisting of weight loss, exhaustion, physical inactivity, slowness and weakness. Phenotypic frailty is characterised by reductions in the reserves of various organ systems and impaired stress tolerance, with increased risk of important endpoints: disability, morbidity and death. The development of sarcopenia is often a conspicuous characteristic, and cognitive decline is a frequent companion; frail individuals may also be obese. According to epidemiological studies, phenotypic frailty can be discerned in 5 to 10\% of community-living older individuals, prefrailty even in 20 to 40\%. To prevent deterioration and development of disability, prefrail and frail individuals should be recognised in time to target interventions in primary care. There is also an emerging interest in various specialties to recognise frailty to better adjust treatments and prevent complications. Multidomain and multisystem interventions are probably the best options for prevention and treatment, but at the moment best evidence is available from exercise. Various pharmacological treatments are being investigated for frailty components, but trial data are scarce so far. In advanced frailty, treatment is moved to appropriate geriatric palliative care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In older trauma patients, the impact of discharge destination on readmission rates is not known. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between the discharge destination and the 30-day readmission rate in older trauma patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A previously validated database of all patients aged 45 years or older undergoing trauma evaluation at our level 1 trauma center between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2008 was analyzed to retrospectively compare the incidences of 30-day readmission between patients discharged to home, to inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and to other extended care facilities (ECFs). Demographic information including age and gender and potentially confounding factors including injury severity, trauma activation level, comorbidities, medications, and preinjury functional status were included. Univariate analysis was undertaken using chi-square testing. Multiple logistic regression was performed with potential confounding variables to evaluate for independent contribution to readmission risk. RESULTS: A total of 960 patients were evaluated; 81 patients (8.4\%) were excluded, leaving 879 patients included in the analysis. Seventy-six patients (8.6\%) were readmitted within 30 d of discharge. Overall, 6\% of those discharged to home, 13\% of those discharged to ECF, and 16\% of those discharged to rehabilitation were readmitted (P {$<$} 0.01 on univariate analysis). Overall, 866 (98.5\%) patients had data recorded for all variables analyzed using multiple logistic regression; among these, only discharge destination was independently associated with the rate of readmission (P {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Discharge to ECFs and inpatient rehabilitation facilities appear to be an independent risk factor for hospital readmissions in this population despite controlling for injury severity and comorbidities. Recognition of this risk factor may aid in the disposition planning of these patients and suggests the need for further evaluation of this correlation at other US medical centers.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disability is commonly considered as an irreversible condition of advanced age. Therefore, preventive actions need to be taken before the disabling cascade is fully established, that is in the pre-disability phase defined "frailty syndrome". The complexity and heterogeneity of frailty requires a clinical approach based on multidimensionality and multidisciplinary. In this paper, we present the main characteristics of the newborn Platform for Evaluation of Frailty and Prevention of Disability (Toulouse, France). INTERVENTION: Persons aged 65 years and older screened for frailty by general practitioners in the Toulouse area are invited to undergo a multidisciplinary evaluation at the Platform. Here, the individual is multidimensionality assessed in order to preventively detect potential risk factors for disability. At the end of the comprehensive evaluation, the team members propose the patient (in agreement with the general practitioner) a preventive intervention program specifically tailored to the his/her needs and resources. RESULTS: Mean age of our population is 82.7 years, with a large majority aged 75 years and older. Most patients are women (61.9\%) Approximately two thirds of patients received any kind of regular help. Regarding level of frailty, 65 patients (41.4\%) were pre-frail, and 83 (52.9\%) frail. For what concerns the functional status, 83.9\% of patients presented slow gait speed, 53.8\% were sedentary, and 57.7\% had poor muscle strength. Only 27.2\% of patients had a SPPB score equal to or higher than 10. Autonomy in ADL was quite well preserved (mean ADL score 5.6 {\textpm} 0.8) as expected, suggesting that the patients of the platform have not yet developed disability. Consistently, IADL showed a marginal loss of autonomy reporting a mean score of 6.0 {\textpm} 2.3. About one third of patients (33.1\%) presented a MMSE score lower than 25. Dementia (measured by the CDR scale) was observed in 11.6\% of the platform population, whereas subjects with mild cognitive impairment (that is CDR equal to 0.5) were 65.8\%. New diagnosed depressive disorders were relatively rare with only 3.2\% of patients showing signs of depression but some people were already treated. Numerous patients presented vision problems with 10.4\% having abnormal findings at the Amsler grid. Finally, it is noteworthy that 9\% of the platform population presented an objective state of protein-energy malnutrition, 34\% an early alteration of nutritional status, while almost everyone (94.9\%) had a vitamin D deficiency (partially explained by the period of the year, that is winter-spring, of most of the measurements). CONCLUSION: The Platform clinically evaluates and intervenes on frailty for the first time at the general population-level. This model may serve as preliminary step towards a wider identification of early signs of the disabling cascade in order to develop more effective preventive interventions.},

However, willingness amongst this group to be randomised and undergo surgery is uncertain. This study assessed UK patients' perceptions of their weight and diabetes, and associations with willingness to participate in RCTs involving bariatric surgery, amongst this population. MATERIALS AND METHODS Postal survey of 1820 patients from four regions in England. Eligible patients were as follows: BMI 30-39.9 kg/m(2), 18-74 years, diagnosis of T2DM {$\geq$}2 years. A reminder survey was sent after 4 weeks. Independent predictors influencing patients' willingness to consider RCT participation were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Thirty-four per cent (614/1820) of patients responded. Weight was considered to be harder to control than diabetes [468/584 (80 \%) vs. 107/600 (17 \%)]. More people reported a negative impact on life for weight rather than diabetes [379/579 (63 \%) vs. 180/574 (31 \%)]. Feeling unsatisfied/very unsatisfied with weight loss ability was common 261/578 (45 \%). Sixty-four per cent (379/594, CI\,=\,60-68) were willing to consider participating in an RCT. In multivariate analysis, negative impact of weight on life (OR\,=\,2.55, 95 \% CI\,=\,1.68-3.89, P\,{$<$}\,0.001) and feeling unsatisfied with weight loss ability (OR\,=\,2.47, 95 \% CI\,=\,1.55-3.95, P\,{$<$}\,0.001) positively influenced patients' willingness to participate in an RCT. CONCLUSION Strong patient interest supports the feasibility of such trials for this group. Perceptions of obesity negatively impacting on life and difficulties in achieving weight loss were common and influenced attitudes to potential participation in bariatric surgery RCTs.},

Design: Cross sectional survey and register data. The CNI was based on sociodemographic factors: elderly persons living alone, children under age 5, unemployed people, people with low educational status, single parents, high mobility, and foreign born people. The CNI weights were calculated from the ratings of Swedish GPs of the impact of these factors on their workload. The CNI scale was transformed into a positive scale to avoid negative values. CNI weights were calculated for each decile of the study population. The risk of poor self reported health in the CNI deciles was estimated by means of a hierarchical logistic regression in the age range 25--74 (n=27 346). The MigMed database comprising all people living in Sweden was used to calculate the CNI for Stockholm. Participants: The Swedish population and the population in Stockholm County. Main results: The means of the CNI for deciles ranged from 61 (most affluent neighbourhoods) to 140 (most deprived) in Stockholm County. The ratio between the tenth and the first decile was 1.66. There was an approximately 150\% increased risk of poor self reported health for people living in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods (OR=2.50) compared with those living in the most affluent ones (OR=1). CNI ratios for the deciles corresponded approximately to the odds ratios of poor self reported health status. Conclusions: The CNI can be used to allocate total primary health care resources.},

The present study analyzes whether there is an association between linking social capital (a theoretical concept describing the amount of trust between individuals and societal institutions) and prescription of antipsychotics, anxiolytics, hypnotics/sedatives, antidepressants, or anti-dementia drugs. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS The entire Swedish population aged 65+, a total of 1,292,816 individuals, were followed from 1 July 2005 until first prescription of psychiatric medication, death, emigration, or the end of the study on 31 December 2010. Small geographic units were used to define neighborhoods. The definition of linking social capital was based on mean voting participation in each neighborhood unit, categorized in three groups. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and between-neighborhood variance in three different models. RESULTS There was an inverse association between the level of linking social capital and prescription of psychiatric medications (except for anti-dementia drugs). The associations decreased, but remained significant, after accounting for age, sex, family income, marital status, country of birth, and education level (except for antidepressants). The OR for prescription of antipsychotics in the crude model was 1.65 (95\% CI 1.53-1.78) and decreased, but remained significant (OR~=~1.26; 95\% CI 1.17-1.35), after adjustment for the individual-level sociodemographic variables. CONCLUSIONS Decision-makers should take into account the potentially negative effect of linking social capital on psychiatric disorders when planning sites of primary care centers and psychiatric clinics, as well as other kinds of community support for elderly patients with such disorders.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES Our objective was to examine the association between neighborhood linking social capital (a concept describing the amount of trust between individuals and societal institutions) and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the elderly. DESIGN The entire Swedish population aged 65+, a total of 1,517,336 men and women, was followed from 1 January 2002 until death, emigration, or the end of the study on 31 December 2010. Small geographic units were used to define neighborhoods. The definition of linking social capital was based on neighborhood voting participation rates, categorized into three groups. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and between-neighborhood variance in three different models. RESULTS The results showed an overall association between linking social capital and all-cause mortality. The significant OR of 1.53 in the group with low linking social capital decreased, but remained significant (OR=1.27), after accounting for age, sex, family income, marital status, country of birth, education level, and region of residence. There were also significant associations between linking social capital and cause-specific mortality in coronary heart disease, psychiatric disorders, cancer, stroke, chronic lower respiratory diseases, type 2 diabetes, and suicide. CONCLUSION There are associations between low linking social capital and mortality from chronic disorders and suicide in the elderly population. Community support for elderly people living in neighborhoods with low levels of linking social capital may need to be strengthened.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Laboratory-based studies have suggested that individual differences in cardiovascular reactivity and stress adaptive capacity are associated with stroke incidence. We test the hypothesis that sense of coherence (SOC), a marker of social stress adaptive capacity, is associated with incident stroke in a population-based prospective cohort study. METHODS: A total of 20,629 participants, aged 41 to 80 years, in the UK European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk study, who had not previously experienced a stroke, completed assessments that included SOC and details of their experience of life events during adulthood. An index of adaptation was constructed from responses to questions concerning over 80,000 adverse life events. RESULTS: During 145,000 person-years of follow-up (mean 7.1 years), 452 participants experienced either a fatal or nonfatal stroke event. A strong (as opposed to a weak) SOC was associated with a reduced rate of stroke incidence (rate ratio 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.60 to 0.96) after adjustment for age, sex, pre-existing myocardial infarction, diabetes, hypertension treatment, family history of stroke, cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure, obesity, social class, education, hostility and depression. No sex difference in this association was observed. Measures of social adversity occurrence and impact were not associated with stroke incidence, whereas faster reported adaptation to adverse event exposure was associated with a reduced rate of stroke incidence (rate ratio 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.81 to 0.98; per standard deviation change in adaptation score, adjusted for age and sex). CONCLUSIONS: Stress adaptive capacity is a potentially important candidate risk factor for stroke.},

INTRODUCTION: In 2010, 22 million women and 5.5 million men were estimated to have osteoporosis in the EU; and 3.5 million new fragility fractures were sustained, comprising 620,000 hip fractures, 520,000 vertebral fractures, 560,000 forearm fractures and 1,800,000 other fractures. The economic burden of incident and prior fragility fractures was estimated at {\texteuro} 37 billion. Previous and incident fractures also accounted for 1,180,000 quality-adjusted life years lost during 2010. The costs are expected to increase by 25 \% in 2025. The majority of individuals who have sustained an osteoporosis-related fracture or who are at high risk of fracture are untreated and the number of patients on treatment is declining. The aim of this report was to characterize the burden of osteoporosis in each of the EU27 countries in 2010 and beyond. METHODS: The data on fracture incidence and costs of fractures in the EU27 were taken from a concurrent publication in this journal (Osteoporosis in the European Union: Medical Management, Epidemiology and Economic Burden) and country specific information extracted. RESULTS: The clinical and economic burden of osteoporotic fractures in 2010 is given for each of the 27 countries of the EU. The costs are expected to increase on average by 25 \% in 2025. The majority of individuals who have sustained an osteoporosis-related fracture or who are at high risk of fracture are untreated and the number of patients on treatment is declining. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the high cost of osteoporosis, a substantial treatment gap and projected increase of the economic burden driven by aging populations, the use of pharmacological prevention of osteoporosis has decreased in recent years, suggesting that a change in healthcare policy concerning the disease is warranted.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health literacy concerns the ability of citizens to meet the complex demands of health in modern society. Data on the distribution of health literacy in general populations and how health literacy impacts health behavior and general health remains scarce. The present study aims to investigate the prevalence of health literacy levels and associations of health literacy with socioeconomic position, health risk behavior, and health status at a population level. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional survey linked to administrative registry data was applied to a randomly selected sample of 15,728 Danish individuals aged {$\geq$}25\,years. By the short form HLS-EU-Q16 health literacy was measured for the domains of healthcare, disease prevention, and health promotion. Adjusted multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to estimate associations of health literacy with demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, health risk behavior (physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, body weight), and health status (sickness benefits, self-assessed health). RESULTS: Overall, 9007 (57.3\%) individuals responded to the survey. Nearly 4 in 10 respondents faced difficulties in accessing, understanding, appraising, and applying health information. Notably, 8.18\% presented with inadequate health literacy and 30.94\% with problematic health literacy. Adjusted for potential confounders, regression analyses showed that males, younger individuals, immigrants, individuals with basic education or income below the national average, and individuals receiving social benefits had substantially higher odds of inadequate health literacy. Among health behavior factors (smoking, high alcohol consumption, and inactivity), only physical behavior [sedentary: OR: 2.31 (95\% CI: 1.81; 2.95)] was associated with inadequate health literacy in the adjusted models. The long-term health risk indicator body-weight showed that individuals with obesity [OR: 1.78 (95\% CI: 1.39; 2.28)] had significantly higher odds of lower health literacy scores. Poor self-assessed health [OR: 4.03 (95\% CI: 3.26; 5.00)] and payments of sickness absence compensation benefits [OR: 1.74 (95\% CI: 1.35; 2.23)] were associated with lower health literacy scores. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a relatively highly educated population, the prevalence of inadequate health literacy is high. Inadequate health literacy is strongly associated with a low socioeconomic position, poor health status, inactivity, and overweight, but to a lesser extent with health behavior factors such as smoking and high alcohol consumption.},

Foot-care behaviour was assessed through the validated Nottingham Assessment of Functional Foot-care scale. A score over 50 demonstrated adequate foot-care behaviour. The score was correlated with several variables. SPSS 23 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Of the 400 individuals, 238(59.5\%) were females and 162(40.5\%) were males. The overall mean age was 52.71\vphantom\{\}11.84 years. Of the total, 228(57\%) had never received any education on proper foot-care; 289(72.3\%) had a scale score of less than or equal to 50. Urban or rural residence, monthly income, literacy level, family history of diabetes, and previous foot-care education provided by the healthcare provider were significant factors associated with good foot-care behaviour (p{$<$}0.05 each).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interest in and debates around health literacy have grown over the last two decades and key to the discussions has been the distinction made between basic functional health literacy, communicative/interactive health literacy and critical health literacy. Of these, critical health literacy is the least well developed and differing interpretations of its constituents and relevance exist. The aim of this study is to rigorously analyse the concept of critical health literacy in order to offer some clarity of definition upon which appropriate theory, well grounded practice and potential measurement tools can be based. METHOD: The study uses a theoretical and colloquial evolutionary concept analysis method to systematically identify the features associated with this concept. A unique characteristic of this method is that it practically combines an analysis of the literature with in depth interviews undertaken with practitioners and policy makers who have an interest in the field. The study also analyses how the concept is understood across the contexts of time, place, discipline and use by health professionals, policy makers and academics. RESULTS: Findings revealed a distinct set of characteristics of advanced personal skills, health knowledge, information skills, effective interaction between service providers and users, informed decision making and empowerment including political action as key features of critical health literacy. The potential consequences of critical health literacy identified are in improving health outcomes, creating more effective use of health services and reducing inequalities in health thus demonstrating the relevance of this concept to public health and health promotion. CONCLUSIONS: While critical health literacy is shown to be a unique concept, there remain significant contextual variations in understanding particularly between academics, practitioners and policy makers. Key attributes presented as part of this concept when it was first introduced in the literature, particularly those around empowerment, social and political action and the existence of the concept at both an individual and population level, have been lost in more recent representations. This has resulted in critical health literacy becoming restricted to a higher order cognitive individual skill rather than a driver for political and social change. The paper argues that in order to retain the uniqueness and usefulness of the concept in practice efforts should be made to avoid this dilution of meaning.},

The Cochrane Consumers and Communication Group (CCCG) publishes systematic reviews in 'health communication and participation', which includes concepts such as shared decision-making, patient-centred care and health literacy. We aimed to select and refine priority topics for systematic reviews in health communication and participation, and use these to identify five priority CCCG Cochrane Reviews. METHODS: Twenty-eight participants (14 consumers, 14 health professionals/decision-makers) attended a 1-day workshop in Australia. Using large-group activities and voting, participants discussed, revised and then selected 12 priority topics from a list of 21 previously identified topics. In mixed small groups, participants refined these topics, exploring underlying problems, who they affect and potential solutions. Thematic analysis identified cross-cutting themes, in addition to key populations and potential interventions for future Cochrane Reviews. We mapped these against CCCG's existing review portfolio to identify five priority reviews. RESULTS: Priority topics included poor understanding and implementation of patient-centred care by health services, the fact that health information can be a low priority for health professionals, communication and coordination breakdowns in health services, and inadequate consumer involvement in health service design. The four themes underpinning the topics were culture and organisational structures, health professional attitudes and assumptions, inconsistent experiences of care, and lack of shared understanding in the sector. Key populations for future reviews were described in terms of social health characteristics (e.g. people from indigenous or culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, elderly people, and people experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage) more than individual health characteristics. Potential interventions included health professional education, interventions to change health service/health professional culture and attitudes, and health service policies and standards. The resulting five priority Cochrane Reviews identified were improving end-of-life care communication, patient/family involvement in patient safety, improving future doctors' communication skills, consumer engagement strategies, and promoting patient-centred care. CONCLUSIONS: Stakeholders identified priority topics for systematic reviews associated with structural and cultural challenges underlying health communication and participation, and were concerned that issues of equity be addressed. Priority-setting with stakeholders presents opportunities and challenges for review producers.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES:: To determine the frequency of medical adverse events in elderly patients admitted to an acute care geriatric unit, the predictive factors of occurrence, and the correlation between adverse events and hospital mortality rates. METHODS:: This prospective study included 171 admissions of patients aged 60 years and older in the acute care geriatric unit in a teaching hospital in Brazil between 2007 and 2008. The following variables were assessed at admission: the patient age, gender, number of prescription drugs, geriatric syndromes (e.g., immobility, postural instability, dementia, depression, delirium, and incontinence), comorbidities, functional status (evaluated with the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living), and severity of illness (evaluated with the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II). The incidence of delirium, infection, mortality, and the prescription of potentially inappropriate medications (based on the Beers criteria) were assessed during hospitalization. An observer who was uninvolved in patient care reported the adverse events. RESULTS:: The mean age of the sample was 78.12 years. A total of 187 medical adverse events occurred in 94 admissions (55\%). The predictors of medical adverse events were undetermined. Compared with the patients with no adverse events, the patients with medical adverse events had a significantly longer hospital stay (21.41{\textpm}15.08 days versus 10.91{\textpm}7.21 days) and a higher mortality rate (39 deaths [41.5\%] versus 17 deaths [22.1\%]). Mortality was significantly predicted by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II score (odds ratio [OR]{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.13, confidence interval [CI] 95\%, 1.07 to 1.20), the Katz score (OR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.47, CI 95\%, 1.18 to 1.83), and medical adverse events (OR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}3.59, CI 95\%, 1.55 to 8.30). CONCLUSION:: Medical adverse events should be monitored in every elderly hospitalized patient because there is no risk profile for susceptible patients, and the consequences of adverse events are serious, sometimes leading to longer hospital stays or even death.},

The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between a high score on the Elder Risk Assessment (ERA) Index and 30-day readmission to the hospital in older patients discharged to a nursing home. PATIENTS: Patients aged {$>$} 60 years residing in the community on January 1, 2005 and subsequently admitted to a local nursing home following hospitalization were included. The cohort was selected from all patients in a primary care internal medicine practice in Rochester, MN. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study that used an electronically archived administrative risk index, the ERA Index, which was derived from demographic and clinical factors. The primary outcome was hospital readmission within 30 days following initial admission to a nursing home. The predictor variable was the ERA Index score. Univariate association between the total ERA Index score and individual components of the ERA Index and 30-day rehospitalization were determined. The ERA Index score cutoff with optimal sensitivity and specificity for hospital readmission was also identified. RESULTS: Of 12 650 patients in the population, 800 were admitted to a facility between 2005 and 2007. Thirty-day readmission was not higher in the group with the highest ERA Index score (top quartile), with a relative risk of 1.72 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.93-3.56) compared with the lowest-scoring group. The second- and third-highest quartiles were significantly associated with higher 30-day readmission. The individual component of the ERA Index that had the strongest association with early readmission was dementia, with an odds ratio of 2.69 (95\% CI, 1.71-4.23). A cutoff score of 5 on the ERA Index resulted in a sensitivity of 0.81 and a specificity of 0.34 with an area under the curve of 0.55. DISCUSSION: Those with the highest ERA Index score, the top quartile, were not at risk for early hospital readmission. The ERA Index does not predict readmissions from the nursing home to the hospital. There is a need to develop a unique index to predict rehospitalizations in nursing home residents.},

This fact has increased the detection of chronic-degenerative diseases, as well as the prescription and consumption of medicines. The elderly are particularly susceptible to adverse drug events or interactions with other drugs due to their physiological changes, genetic predisposition and environmental exposure. It becomes necessary to adapt the health systems with integral and multidisciplinary approaches suitable to this demographic change, as the knowledge about appropriate prescription, clinical pharmacology and medication use in the elderly has become essential. It has been shown that about two thirds of elderly patients receive inappropriate drug doses, and a substantial percentage of their hospital admissions are associated with potentially preventable toxic effects of drugs. To date, expert criteria, error detection tools and educational prescription plans have been developed by expert consensus for the safe use of drugs in the geriatric population. The objective of this study is a brief review of the principal physiological changes in an older adult, and summarize the contributions of the consensuses on prescription.},

DESIGN: This review was conducted with reference to methods set out in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42016053402). DATA SOURCES: A search from seven electronic databases (2003-2016). REVIEW METHOD: The quality of evidence and strength of the studies was evaluated systematically, followed by an assessment of risks of bias by two reviewers with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. RESULTS: Eighteen randomized controlled trials demonstrated a low to moderate quality evidence on the improvements of medication adherence with educational interventions. Participants with type 2 diabetes benefited from education interventions but not those with hypertension. No randomized controlled trials (RCT) was found for participants with hyperlipidaemia. Education that was conducted at home showed better medication adherence than education conducted in clinics. Medication adherence was improved after two to three sessions but no significant differences found after three sessions. CONCLUSION: Through education, health literacy is improved, thus improving medication adherence. IMPACT: A plethora of educational interventions have been implemented in the clinical settings, but no reviews have hitherto been conducted on their effectiveness. This review suggested that education improves health literacy which is directly proportionate to optimal disease management including medication adherence. The suggestions proposed in this review may impact the individual in terms of their adherence to medication to tackle exacerbation and relapse of chronic diseases and also proposed suggestions for future implementation of an education intervention.},

  abstract = {AIM: The present study investigated whether dual-task Timed Up \& Go tests (TUG) could identify prefrail individuals more sensitively than the single-task TUG (TUGsingle ) in community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited adults aged 50 years and older who actively participated in local community programs. Time taken to complete single-task TUG and dual-task TUG, carrying a cup of water (TUGmanual ) or carrying out serial-3 subtraction (TUGcognitive ) while executing TUG, was measured. Prefrailty status was defined based on Fried's phenotypic definition. RESULTS: Of the 65 participants (mean age 71.5+/-8.1 years), 33.3\% of the 12 middle-aged (50-64 years) and 62.3\% of the 53 older ({$>$}/=65 years) adults were prefrail, mainly as a result of weak grip strength. The receiver operating characteristic curve analyses for differentiating prefrailty from non-frailty showed that the area under the curve (AUC) for TUGmanual (0.73, 95\% CI 0.60-0.86) was better than that for TUGsingle (0.67, 95\% CI 0.54-0.80), whereas the AUC value was not significant for TUGcognitive (0.60, 95\% CI 0.46-0.74). The optimal cut-off points for detecting prefrailty using TUGsingle , TUGmanual and TUGcognitive were 7.7 s (sensitivity 68\%), 8.2 s (sensitivity 83\%), and 14.3 s (sensitivity 29\%), respectively. After adjusting for age, logistic regression analyses showed that individuals with TUGmanual 8.2 s or slower were 7.2-fold more likely to have prefrailty than those with TUGmanual faster than 8.2 s. CONCLUSION: TUGmanual is more valid and sensitive than TUGsingle in identifying prefrail individuals. The TUGmanual thus could serve as a screening tool for early detection of individuals with prefrailty in community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED: The risk of morbidity and mortality for hospitalized patients with cirrhosis is high and incompletely captured by conventional indices. We sought to evaluate the predictive role of frailty in an observational cohort study of inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis between 2010 and 2013. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included discharge to a rehabilitation hospital, 30-day readmission, and length of stay. Frailty was assessed with three metrics: activities of daily living (ADL), the Braden Scale, and the Morse fall risk score. A predictive model was validated by randomly dividing the population into training and validation cohorts: 734 patients were admitted 1358 times in the study period. The overall 90-day mortality was 18.3\%. The 30-day readmission rate was 26.6\%, and the rate of discharge to a rehabilitation facility was 14.3\%. Adjusting for sex, age, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, sodium, and Charlson index, the odds ratio for the effect of an ADL score of less than 12 of 15 on mortality is 1.83 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-3.20). A predictive model for 90-day mortality including ADL and Braden Scale yielded C statistics of 0.83 (95\% CI 0.80-0.86) and 0.77 (95\% CI 0.71-0.83) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Discharge to a rehabilitation hospital is predicted by both the ADL ({$<$}12) and Braden Scale ({$<$}16), with respective adjusted odds ratios of 3.78 (95\% CI 1.97-7.29) and 6.23 (95\% CI 2.53-15.4). Length of stay was associated with the Braden Scale ({$<$}16) (hazard ratio\,=\,0.63, 95\% CI 0.44-0.91). No frailty measure was associated with 30-day readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Readily available, standardized measures of frailty predict 90-day mortality, length of stay, and rehabilitation needs for hospitalized patients with cirrhosis.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Limiting the number of dependent older people in coming years will be a major economic and human challenge. In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed the <<Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE)>> approach. The aim of the ICOPE program is to enable as many people as possible to age in good health. To reach this objective, the WHO proposes to follow the trajectory of an individual's intrinsic capacity, which is the composite of all their physical and mental capacities and comprised of multiple domains including mobility, cognition, vitality / nutrition, psychological state, vision, hearing. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the INSPIRE ICOPE-CARE program is to implement, in clinical practice at a large scale, the WHO ICOPE program in the Occitania region, in France, to promote healthy aging and maintain the autonomy of seniors using digital medicine. METHOD: The target population is independent seniors aged 60 years and over. To follow this population, the 6 domains of intrinsic capacity are systematically monitored with pre-established tools proposed by WHO especially STEP 1 which has been adapted in digital form to make remote and large-scale monitoring possible. Two tools were developed: the ICOPE MONITOR, an application, and the BOTFRAIL, a conversational robot. Both are connected to the Gerontopole frailty database. STEP 1 is performed every 4-6 months by professionals or seniors themselves. If a deterioration in one or more domains of intrinsic capacity is identified, an alert is generated by an algorithm which allows health professionals to quickly intervene. The operational implementation of the INSPIRE ICOPE-CARE program in Occitania is done by the network of Territorial Teams of Aging and Prevention of Dependency (ETVPD) which have more than 2,200 members composed of professionals in the medical, medico-social and social sectors. Targeted actions have started to deploy the use of STEP 1 by healthcare professionals (physicians, nurses, pharmacists,{\dots}) or different institutions like French National old age insurance fund (CNAV), complementary pension funds (CEDIP), Departmental Council of Haute Garonne, etc. Perspective: The INSPIRE ICOPE-CARE program draws significantly on numeric tools, e-health and digital medicine to facilitate communication and coordination between professionals and seniors. It seeks to screen and monitor 200,000 older people in Occitania region within 3 to 5 years and promote preventive actions. The French Presidential Plan Grand Age aims to largely implement the WHO ICOPE program in France following the experience of the INSPIRE ICOPE-CARE program in Occitania.},

Management and control of C. trachomatis is a challenge, largely due to its asymptomatic nature and our incomplete understanding of its natural history. Although chlamydia screening programs have been implemented worldwide, several countries have observed increasing rates of reported chlamydia cases. We reviewed the literature relating to the long-term complications of C. trachomatis, as well as screening strategies, treatment, and prevention strategies for reducing chlamydia in the population. Articles from 1950-2010 were identified through a Medline search using the keyword "Chlamydia trachomatis" combined with "screening", "pelvic inflammatory disease", "endometritis", "salpingitis", "infertility", "ectopic pregnancy", "urethritis", "epididymitis", "proctitis", "prostatitis", "reinfection", "cost-effectiveness", "treatment", "vaccines", or "prevention". Progression of C. trachomatis varies, and recurrent infections are common. Currently, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of chlamydia screening. Higher quality studies are needed to determine the efficacy of more frequent screening, on a broader range of sequelae, including infertility and ectopic pregnancy, in addition to pelvic inflammatory disease. Studies should focus on delineating the natural history of recurrent infections, paying particular attention to treatment failures. Furthermore, alternatives to screening, such as vaccines, should continue to be explored.},

  abstract = {There has been enormous debate regarding the possibility of a link between childhood vaccinations and the subsequent development of autism. This has in recent times become a major public health issue with vaccine preventable diseases increasing in the community due to the fear of a 'link' between vaccinations and autism. We performed a meta-analysis to summarise available evidence from case-control and cohort studies on this topic (MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar up to April, 2014). Eligible studies assessed the relationship between vaccine administration and the subsequent development of autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Two reviewers extracted data on study characteristics, methods, and outcomes. Disagreement was resolved by consensus with another author. Five cohort studies involving 1,256,407 children, and five case-control studies involving 9,920 children were included in this analysis. The cohort data revealed no relationship between vaccination and autism (OR: 0.99; 95\% CI: 0.92 to 1.06) or ASD (OR: 0.91; 95\% CI: 0.68 to 1.20), nor was there a relationship between autism and MMR (OR: 0.84; 95\% CI: 0.70 to 1.01), or thimerosal (OR: 1.00; 95\% CI: 0.77 to 1.31), or mercury (Hg) (OR: 1.00; 95\% CI: 0.93 to 1.07). Similarly the case-control data found no evidence for increased risk of developing autism or ASD following MMR, Hg, or thimerosal exposure when grouped by condition (OR: 0.90, 95\% CI: 0.83 to 0.98; p=0.02) or grouped by exposure type (OR: 0.85, 95\% CI: 0.76 to 0.95; p=0.01). Findings of this meta-analysis suggest that vaccinations are not associated with the development of autism or autism spectrum disorder. Furthermore, the components of the vaccines (thimerosal or mercury) or multiple vaccines (MMR) are not associated with the development of autism or autism spectrum disorder.},

We aim to identify multi-morbidity patterns and associations with potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP), subsequent hospitalisation and mortality in octogenarians. Methods: life and Living in Advanced Age; a Cohort Study in New Zealand (LiLACS NZ) examined health outcomes of 421 Maori (indigenous to New Zealand), aged 80-90 and 516 non-Maori, aged 85 years in 2010. Presence of 14 chronic conditions was ascertained from self-report, general practice and hospitalisation records and physical assessments. Agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis identified clusters of participants with co-existing conditions. Multivariate regression models examined the associations between clusters and PIP, 48-month hospitalisations and mortality. Results: six clusters were identified for Maori and non-Maori, respectively. The associations between clusters and outcomes differed between Maori and non-Maori. In Maori, those in the complex multi-morbidity cluster had the highest prevalence of inappropriately prescribed medications and in cluster 'diabetes' (20\% of sample) had higher risk of hospitalisation and mortality at 48-month follow-up. In non-Maori, those in the 'depression-arthritis' (17\% of the sample) cluster had both highest prevalence of inappropriate medications and risk of hospitalisation and mortality. Conclusions: in octogenarians, hospitalisation and mortality are better predicted by profiles of clusters of conditions rather than the presence or absence of a specific condition. Further research is required to determine if the cluster approach can be used to target patients to optimise resource allocation and improve outcomes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) use is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there is paucity of data on how hospitalization affects PIMs use in older adults with CKD. Therefore, we aimed to measure the impact of hospitalization on PIMs use in older CKD patients, and identify factors predicting PIMs use. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in older adults ({$>$}/= 65 years) with CKD admitted to an Australian tertiary care hospital over a 6-month period. PIMs use was measured, upon admission and at discharge, using the Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI) and Beers criteria (2015 version) for medications recommended to be avoided in older adults and under certain conditions. RESULTS: The median age of the 204 patients was 83 years (interquartile range (IQR): 76-87 years) and most were men (61\%). Overall, the level of PIMs use (MAI) decreased from admission to discharge [median (IQR): 6 (3-12) to 5 (2-9); p {$<$} 0.01)]. More than half of the participants (55\%) had at least one PIM per Beers criteria on admission, which reduced by discharge (48\%; p {$<$} 0.01). People admitted with a higher number of medications (beta 0.72, 95\% CI 0.56 to 0.88) and lower eGFR values (beta -0.11, 95\% CI -0.18 to -0.04) had higher MAI scores after adjusting for age, sex and Charlson's comorbidity index (CCI). CONCLUSIONS: PIMs were commonly used in older CKD patients. Hospitalization was associated with a reduction in PIMs use, but there was considerable scope for improvement in these susceptible individuals.},

This study compared morbidity and mortality patterns of newborns  admitted to a regional and a district hospital in Ghana to determine outcome,  risk and modifiable factors associated with mortality. OBJECTIVE: This study  compared morbidity and mortality patterns of newborns admitted to a regional and  a district hospital in Ghana to determine outcome, risk and modifiable factors  associated with mortality. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving a  records-review over one year at the Upper West Regional Hospital, and three years  at St Joseph's District Hospital, Jirapa was carried out. Age, sex, gestational  age, weight, duration of admission, diagnosis, among others were examined. The  data were analysed and statistical inference made. RESULTS: Altogether, 2004  newborns were examined, comprising 1,241(62\%) from St Joseph's District Hospital  and 763(38\%) from Upper West Regional Hospital. The proportion of neonatal deaths  was similar, 8.94\% (St Joseph's District Hospital) and 8.91\% (Upper West Regional  Hospital). Prematurity, neonatal sepsis, birth asphyxia, low birth weight,  neonatal jaundice and pneumonia contributed the most to mortality and suspected  infections including malaria accounted for almost half (45.5\%). Mortality was  significantly associated with duration of stay of 48 hours, being premature, and  being younger than 3 days. CONCLUSION: Majority of the mortality among the  neonates admitted was due to preventable causes. Better stabilization and further  studies on the epidemiology of sepsis, prematurity, low birth weight, including  the contribution of malaria to these and outcome of transferred neonates are  needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality among neonates. The risk factors and clinical outcomes of sepsis are poorly understood.  Most cases of sepsis occurred mostly within the first week of newborns life  related to perinatal risk factors. Late onset sepsis is related to hospital  acquired infections which is seen after seven days of age. The purpose of this  study was to assess clinical outcome and risk factors of neonatal sepsis in  Felege Hiwot referral hospital Bahir Dar, North West Ethiopia. RESULTS: Among the  total 225 neonatal charts reviewed; 164 (72.9\%) were age less than or equal to  7~days, and 144 (64\%) were males. About 29 (12.9\%) neonates were with irregular  respiratory signs and 40 (17.8\%) had meconium aspiration syndrome. Regarding the  clinical outcome of neonatal sepsis: 189 (84\%) were improved after treatment, 9  (4\%) were died and 13 (5.8\%) referred to other organizations for further  treatment. Respiratory distress syndrome [AOR~=~0.258 (0.072-0.930)] and meconium  aspiration syndrome [AOR~=~0.1989 (0.059-0.664)] were the determinant factors for  poor outcome of neonatal sepsis. CONCLUSION: The clinical outcome of neonatal  sepsis in Felege Hiwot referral hospital was not satisfactory. The significant  risk factors for poor outcome of neonatal sepsis were respiratory distress  syndrome and meconium aspiration syndrome. Recommendations to improve neonatal  outcome are: performing essential newborn care for all newborns and arranging  appropriate follow up until the end of neonatal period, increasing antenatal care  and early detection and management of neonatal infections or problems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of death in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC). Increasing antibiotic resistance in early onset ({$<$}\,72~h  of life) bloodstream infection (EO-BSI) pathogens in LMIC has reduced the  effectiveness of the recommended empiric antibiotic regimen (ampicillin plus  gentamicin). METHODS: We retrospectively analysed blood culture-confirmed EO-BSI  episodes at nine neonatal units from three central and six peripheral hospitals  in the Western Cape Province, South Africa between 1 January 2017 and 31 December  2018. Clinical and electronic laboratory records were reviewed to determine  pathogen profile, empiric antibiotic coverage rates and factors associated with  EO-BSI attributable mortality, stratified by hospital type. RESULTS: Of the 8252  blood culture specimens submitted for the investigation of suspected EO-BSI, 136  EO-BSI episodes yielding 141 pathogens were identified with an EO-BSI rate of 1.3  and 0.5 episodes/1000 live births at central and peripheral hospitals  respectively. Preterm (93/136; 68.3\%) and low birth weight (84/136; 61.8\%)  neonates were most affected. The predominant pathogens were Streptococcus  agalactiae (46/136; 34\%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17/136; 13\%), Listeria  monocytogenes (11/136; 8\%), Acinetobacter baumannii (11/136; 8\%) and Escherichia  coli (11/136; 8\%). The empiric antibiotic (ampicillin plus gentamicin) coverage  rate was 64\% (95\% CI 51-74) at central hospitals and 84\% (95\% CI 74-94) at  peripheral hospitals. Neonates with Gram-negative EO-BSI and discordant empiric  antibiotic therapy had almost four-fold and three-fold higher odds of death  respectively. CONCLUSION: Preterm and low birth weight neonates are most  vulnerable to EO-BSI and have higher odds of death with Gram-negative pathogens  and discordant empiric antibiotic therapy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To assess the ability of antihypertensive drug treatment to reduce the risk of nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke in isolated systolic hypertension. DESIGN Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled. SETTING Community-based ambulatory population in tertiary care centers. PARTICIPANTS 4736 persons (1.06\%) from 447,921 screenees aged 60 years and above were randomized (2365 to active treatment, 2371 to placebo). Systolic blood pressure ranged from 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg. Of the participants, 3161 were not receiving antihypertensive medication at initial contact, and 1575 were. The average systolic blood pressure was 170 mm Hg; average diastolic blood pressure, 77 mm Hg. The mean age was 72 years, 57\% were women, and 14\% were black. INTERVENTIONS --Participants were stratified by clinical center and by antihypertensive medication status at initial contact. For step 1 of the trial, dose 1 was chlorthalidone, 12.5 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 25 mg/d. For step 2, dose 1 was atenolol, 25 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 50 mg/d. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary. Nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke. Secondary. Cardiovascular and coronary morbidity and mortality, all-cause mortality, and quality of life measures. RESULTS Average follow-up was 4.5 years. The 5-year average systolic blood pressure was 155 mm Hg for the placebo group and 143 mm Hg for the active treatment group, and the 5-year average diastolic blood pressure was 72 and 68 mm Hg, respectively. The 5-year incidence of total stroke was 5.2 per 100 participants for active treatment and 8.2 per 100 for placebo. The relative risk by proportional hazards regression analysis was 0.64 (P = .0003). For the secondary end point of clinical nonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary death, the relative risk was 0.73. Major cardiovascular events were reduced (relative risk, 0.68). For deaths from all causes, the relative risk was 0.87. CONCLUSION In persons aged 60 years and over with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive stepped-care drug treatment with low-dose chlorthalidone as step 1 medication reduced the incidence of total stroke by 36\%, with 5-year absolute benefit of 30 events per 1000 participants. Major cardiovascular events were reduced, with 5-year absolute benefit of 55 events per 1000.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients who are referred for possible bariatric surgery (BS) intervention undergo a series of assessments conducted by an interdisciplinary health care team to determine suitability for surgery. Herein, we report the initial validation and reliability studies of the Bariatric Interprofessional Psychosocial Assessment Suitability Scale (BIPASS) and its relationship to interdisciplinary psychosocial assessment practices for BS. METHODS This study was conducted at the Toronto Western Hospital, a Level 1A BS center of excellence accredited by the American College of Surgeons. Phase I: a total of 4 blinded raters applied the BIPASS to 31 randomly selected BS cases referred to our program to establish interrater reliability. Phase II: in all, 3 raters with clinical experience in bariatric psychosocial care applied the BIPASS to 54 randomly selected BS cases. RESULTS In total, 46 of 54 (85.1\%) patients were women. The median age of all patient cases was 49 years (range: 21-74). Raters׳ BIPASS scores ranged from 4-52 (median = 19.24, standard deviation =10.38). BIPASS scores were highly predictive of the BS psychosocial outcome (area under curve = 0.915; 95\% CI: 0.844-0.985; p {$<$} 0.001). A BIPASS score of {$\geq$}16 was chosen as the cutoff score for further clinical assessment before proceeding with surgical evaluation based on a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (sensitivity = 0.839; specificity = 0.783). The instrument has very good interrater reliability (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.847) even among novice raters. CONCLUSION The findings show that the BIPASS is a comprehensive screening tool in the psychosocial assessment of BS candidates, which standardizes the evaluation process and systematically identify at-risk patients for negative outcomes after BS.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal bacterial infections have long been recognized as an important cause of acute morbidity and mortality, but long-term  neurodevelopmental consequences have not been comprehensively described and  discussed. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to summarize evidence on the pathogenesis,  diagnosis, and epidemiology of long-term sequelae after neonatal bacterial sepsis  and meningitis. We also discuss approaches for future studies to quantify the  public health impact of neonatal infection-associated neurodevelopmental  impairment. SOURCES: We identified studies, both research articles and reviews,  which provide mechanistic information on the long-term disease, as well as  epidemiological studies that describe the frequency of neurodevelopmental  impairment in children with and, for comparison, without a history of neonatal  bacterial infection. Tools currently used in clinical practice and research  settings to assess neurodevelopmental impairment were also reviewed. CONTENT: We  first enumerate potential direct and indirect mechanisms that can lead to brain  injury following neonatal infections. We then discuss summary data, either  frequencies or measures of association, from epidemiological studies. Risk  factors that predict long-term outcomes are also described. Finally, we describe  clinical approaches for identifying children with neurodevelopmental impairment  and provide an overview of common diagnostic tools. IMPLICATIONS: The limited  number of studies that describe the long-term consequences of neonatal  infections, often undertaken in high-income settings and using variable designs  and diagnostic tools, are not sufficient to inform clinical practice and policy  prioritization. Multi-country studies with follow-up into adolescence,  standardized diagnostic approaches, and local comparator groups are needed,  especially in low and middle-income countries where the incidence of neonatal  sepsis is high.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Canadians' health care-seeking behaviour for physical and mental health issues was examined using the international Quality and Cost of Primary Care (QUALICOPC) survey that was conducted in 2013 in Canada. METHOD: This study used the cross-sectional Patient Experiences Survey collected from 7260 patients in 759 practices across 10 Canadian provinces as part of the QUALICOPC study. A Responsive Care Scale (RCS) was constructed to reflect the degree of health care-seeking behaviour across 11 health conditions. Using several patient characteristics as independent variables, four multiple regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Patients' self-reports indicated that there were gender differences in health care-seeking behaviour, with women reporting they visited their primary care provider to a greater extent than did men for both physical and mental health concerns. Overall, patients were less likely to seek care for mental health concerns in comparison to physical health concerns. For both women and men, the results of the regressions indicated that age, illness prevention, trust in physicians and chronic conditions were important factors when explaining health care-seeking behaviours for mental health concerns. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the gender differences in health care-seeking behaviour advances previous research by exploring in detail the variables predicting differences in health care-seeking behaviour for men and women. The variables were better predictors of health care-seeking behaviour in response to mental health concerns than physical health concerns, likely reflecting greater variation among those seeking mental health care. This study has implications for those working to improve barriers to health care access by identifying those more likely to engage in health care-seeking behaviours and the variables predicting health care-seeking. Consequently, those who are not accessing primary care can be targeted and policies can be developed and put in place to promote their health care-seeking behavior.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a major contributor to neonatal mortality, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). WHO advocates  ampicillin-gentamicin as first-line therapy for the management of neonatal  sepsis. In the BARNARDS observational cohort study of neonatal sepsis and  antimicrobial resistance in LMICs, common sepsis pathogens were characterised via  whole genome sequencing (WGS) and antimicrobial resistance profiles. In this  substudy of BARNARDS, we aimed to assess the use and efficacy of empirical  antibiotic therapies commonly used in LMICs for neonatal sepsis. METHODS: In  BARNARDS, consenting mother-neonates aged 0-60 days dyads were enrolled on  delivery or neonatal presentation with suspected sepsis at 12 BARNARDS clinical  sites in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Rwanda, and South  Africa. Stillborn babies were excluded from the study. Blood samples were  collected from neonates presenting with clinical signs of sepsis, and WGS and  minimum inhibitory concentrations for antibiotic treatment were determined for  bacterial isolates from culture-confirmed sepsis. Neonatal outcome data were  collected following enrolment until 60 days of life. Antibiotic usage and  neonatal outcome data were assessed. Survival analyses were adjusted to take into  account potential clinical confounding variables related to the birth and  pathogen. Additionally, resistance profiles, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic  probability of target attainment, and frequency of resistance (ie, resistance  defined by in-vitro growth of isolates when challenged by antibiotics) were  assessed. Questionnaires on health structures and antibiotic costs evaluated  accessibility and affordability. FINDINGS: Between Nov 12, 2015, and Feb 1, 2018,  36\,285 neonates were enrolled into the main BARNARDS study, of whom 9874 had  clinically diagnosed sepsis and 5749 had available antibiotic data. The four most  commonly prescribed antibiotic combinations given to 4451 neonates (77{$\cdot$}42\%) of  5749 were ampicillin-gentamicin, ceftazidime-amikacin,  piperacillin-tazobactam-amikacin, and amoxicillin clavulanate-amikacin. This  dataset assessed 476 prescriptions for 442 neonates treated with one of these  antibiotic combinations with WGS data (all BARNARDS countries were represented in  this subset except India). Multiple pathogens were isolated, totalling 457  isolates. Reported mortality was lower for neonates treated with  ceftazidime-amikacin than for neonates treated with ampicillin-gentamicin (hazard  ratio [adjusted for clinical variables considered potential confounders to  outcomes] 0{$\cdot$}32, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}14-0{$\cdot$}72; p=0{$\cdot$}0060). Of 390 Gram-negative isolates, 379  (97{$\cdot$}2\%) were resistant to ampicillin and 274 (70{$\cdot$}3\%) were resistant to  gentamicin. Susceptibility of Gram-negative isolates to at least one antibiotic  in a treatment combination was noted in 111 (28{$\cdot$}5\%) to ampicillin-gentamicin; 286  (73{$\cdot$}3\%) to amoxicillin clavulanate-amikacin; 301 (77{$\cdot$}2\%) to ceftazidime-amikacin;  and 312 (80{$\cdot$}0\%) to piperacillin-tazobactam-amikacin. A probability of target  attainment of 80\% or more was noted in 26 neonates (33{$\cdot$}7\% [SD 0{$\cdot$}59]) of 78 with  ampicillin-gentamicin; 15 (68{$\cdot$}0\% [3{$\cdot$}84]) of 27 with amoxicillin  clavulanate-amikacin; 93 (92{$\cdot$}7\% [0{$\cdot$}24]) of 109 with ceftazidime-amikacin; and 70  (85{$\cdot$}3\% [0{$\cdot$}47]) of 76 with piperacillin-tazobactam-amikacin. However, antibiotic  and country effects could not be distinguished. Frequency of resistance was  recorded most frequently with fosfomycin (in 78 isolates [68{$\cdot$}4\%] of 114),  followed by colistin (55 isolates [57{$\cdot$}3\%] of 96), and gentamicin (62 isolates  [53{$\cdot$}0\%] of 117). Sites in six of the seven countries (excluding South Africa)  stated that the cost of antibiotics would influence treatment of neonatal sepsis.  INTERPRETATION: Our data raise questions about the empirical use of combined  ampicillin-gentamicin for neonatal sepsis in LMICs because of its high resistance  and high rates of frequency of resistance and low probability of target  attainment. Accessibility and affordability need to be considered when advocating  antibiotic treatments with variance in economic health structures across LMICs.

The purpose of this study is to determine (1) if a relationship exists between health literacy and self-reported or objectively measured medication adherence and (2) which aspect or aspects of medication nonadherence are most associated with health literacy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This is a multicenter, cross-sectional survey study of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), taking one or more antidiabetes medication for {$\geq$}6 months with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measure on record. Data collected included patient demographics (age, gender, race, language, highest level of education, injectable diabetes medication use, last HbA1c, and diabetes medication refill history) and two survey instruments (the Morisky eight-item Medication Adherence Scale [MMAS-8] and the short-form Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults [s-TOFHLA]). Descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations were assessed, along with linear and logistic regression. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-two patients with an average HbA1c level of 8.1\% were included. Of these subjects, 32.8\% had limited health literacy as measured by the s-TOFHLA, 58.9\% had low adherence as measured by MMAS-8, and 65.1\% were nonadherent based on cumulative medication gap (CMG) analysis. Age was associated with s-TOFHLA (-0.411; P{$<$}0.01) and MMAS-8 (0.157; P{$<$}0.05) scores. HbA1c was associated with MMAS-8 (-0.209; P{$<$}0.01) and CMG (0.152; P{$<$}0.05) scores. There was no significant association between s-TOFHLA and MMAS-8 or CMG. However, s-TOFHLA was positively related to MMAS-8 question 8, assessing difficulty remembering to take medications (P=0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy level is not associated with self-reported or objectively measured medication adherence in underserved patients with T2DM. Lower health literacy scores are associated with a patient experiencing difficulty remembering to take medications.},

DESIGN: Quasiexperimental; matched and unmatched. SETTING: Community, home care. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred seventy individuals receiving care from a large home care agency after hospitalization. INTERVENTION: A restorative care model based on principles adapted from geriatric medicine, nursing, rehabilitation, goal attainment, chronic care management, and behavioral change theory. MEASUREMENTS: Hospital readmission, length of home care episode. RESULTS: Among the matched pairs, 13.2\% of participants who received restorative care were readmitted to an acute hospital during the episode of home care, versus 17.6\% of those who received usual care. Individuals receiving the restorative model of home care were 32\% less likely to be readmitted than those receiving usual care (conditional odds ratio = 0.68, 95\% confidence interval = 0.43-1.08). The mean length of home care episodes was 20.3 {\textpm} 14.8 days in the restorative care group and 29.1 {\textpm} 31.7 days in the usual care group (P {$<$} .001). Results were similar in unmatched analyses. CONCLUSION: Although statistical significance was marginal, results suggest that the restorative care model offers an effective approach to reducing the occurrence of avoidable readmissions. It was previously shown that the restorative model of home care was associated with better functional recovery, fewer emergency department visits, and shorter episodes of home care. This model could be incorporated into usual home care practices and care delivery redesign.},

Early detection of its risk  factors and early treatment of its etiologies are major challenges. However, few  studies in developing countries have provided data needed to tackle it. We aimed  to determine the prevalence, predictors, etiologies and outcome of NRD in a  tertiary health care centre of Cameroon. METHODS: We analyzed the hospital files  of all newborns admitted to the Neonatal unit of Douala General Hospital from  1(st) January 2011 to 28(th) February 2013. NRD was diagnosed based on the  presence of one or more of the following signs: an abnormal respiratory rate,  expiratory grunting, nasal flaring, chest wall recessions and thoraco-abdominal  asynchrony with or without cyanosis, in their files. Socio-demographic and  clinical variables of newborns and their mothers were analyzed using logistic  regression analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of NRD was 47.5\% out of the 703  newborns studied. Acute fetal distress, elective caesarean delivery, APGAR score  {$<$} 7 at the 1(st) minute, prematurity, male gender and macrosomia were independent  predictors of NRD. The main etiologies were neonatal infections (31\%) and  transient tachypnea of the newborn (25\%). Its neonatal mortality rate was 24.5\%,  mainly associated with neonatal sepsis and hyaline membrane disease. CONCLUSION:  NRD is a frequent emergency and causes high morbidity and mortality. Most of its  risk factors and etiologies are preventable. Adequate follow-up of pregnancy and  labor for timely intervention may improve the neonatal outcomes.},

The role of certain risk factors of dementia may change during life, and the importance of having a life-course perspective has been acknowledged. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of midlife and late-life body mass index (BMI) with late-life dementia/Alzheimer's disease (AD) and whether the association was independent of other obesity-related co-morbidities. METHODS: The association between midlife BMI (mean age 50.2, SD 6.0) and late-life BMI (mean age 71.2, SD 4.0) and incident dementia later in life (mean age 75.7, SD 5.0) were investigated among 1,304 participants of the longitudinal population-based Cardiovascular risk factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) study, conducted in Eastern Finland. The duration of follow-up was 26 years. The diagnosis of dementia was based on DSM-IV criteria and the probable and possible AD on the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. RESULTS: Higher midlife BMI was associated with higher risk of incident dementia (adjusted HR, 95\% CI 1.07, 1.00-1.14). However, decrease in BMI from midlife to late-life was associated with higher risk of dementia (1.14, 1.03-1.25 for one-unit decrease) and AD (1.20, 1.09-1.33). High late-life BMI was associated with lower risk of AD (0.89, 0.81-0.98) but the association with dementia was less evident (0.94, 0.86-1.03). CONCLUSION: Higher midlife BMI is related to higher risk of dementia and AD, independently of obesity-related risk factors and co-morbidities. Steeper decrease of BMI and low late-life BMI are associated with higher risk of dementia and AD. These findings highlight the importance of life-course perspective when assessing the association between BMI and cognition.},

Thus, the mental status tests were administered four times: times 1 and 2 at CSHA-1 and times 3 and 4 at CSHA-2. Mean difference scores and percent of baseline scores showed relatively small group changes over both short and long test-retest intervals for the MMSE and the 3MS. A reliable change index based on a linear regression model controlled for practice effects, psychometric errors due to low reliability, regression to the mean, and accounted for the effects of various demographic variables. Consequently, this reliable change index provided a better estimate of the amount of change that occurred for individual participants than did the mean Retest-Test 1 difference, percent of baseline change, or a reliable change index based on a Retest-Test 1 difference score. Normative data for the change scores are provided.},

The present study evaluated the reliability and validity of the IPAQ among adults aged 65 years and older. METHODS: The study included 164 men and 161 women selected from participants of the Fujiwara-kyo Study, a prospective cohort of elderly Japanese adults. To examine test-retest reliability, the participants were asked to complete the IPAQ twice, 2 weeks apart. The criterion validity of the IPAQ was tested by using an accelerometer. RESULTS: Based on intraclass correlation coefficients, the reliability of the total IPAQ was 0.65 and 0.57 for men and women, respectively, aged 65 to 74 years and 0.50 and 0.56 for those aged 75 to 89 years. The Spearman correlation coefficients between total IPAQ score and total physical activity measured by accelerometer (TPA-AC) were 0.42 and 0.49 for men and women, respectively, aged 65 to 74 and 0.53 and 0.49 for those aged 75 to 89. Weighted kappa coefficients between total IPAQ score and TPA-AC were 0.49 and 0.39 for men and women, respectively, aged 65 to 74 and 0.46 and 0.47 for those aged 75 to 89. CONCLUSIONS: The reliability of the IPAQ was not sufficient, but the validity was adequate. Although there were some limitations with regard to repeatability and agreement in classification, the IPAQ was a useful tool for assessing physical activity among elderly adults.},

  abstract = {Many pathways connect stress and obesity, two highly prevalent problems facing society today. First, stress interferes with cognitive processes such as executive function and self-regulation. Second, stress can affect behavior by inducing overeating and consumption of foods that are high in calories, fat, or sugar; by decreasing physical activity; and by shortening sleep. Third, stress triggers physiological changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, reward processing in the brain, and possibly the gut microbiome. Finally, stress can stimulate production of biochemical hormones and peptides such as leptin, ghrelin, and neuropeptide Y. Obesity itself can be a stressful state due to the high prevalence of weight stigma. This article therefore traces the contribution of weight stigma to stress and obesogenic processes, ultimately describing a vicious cycle of stress to obesity to stigma to stress. Current obesity prevention efforts focus solely on eating and exercise; the evidence reviewed in this article points to stress as an important but currently overlooked public policy target.},

Our aim was to study recognition of cognitive impairment and its association with mortality. METHODS: 200 inpatients aged over 60\,years were recruited at the Department of General Internal Medicine at University Hospital MAS in Malm{\"o}, Sweden. The MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) and the CDT (Clock-Drawing Test) were performed and related to recognition rates by patients, staff physicians, nurses and informants. The impact of abnormal cognitive test results on mortality was studied using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: 55 patients (28\%) had no cognitive impairment while 68 patients (34\%) had 1 abnormal test result (on MMSE or CDT) and 77 patients (39\%) had 2 abnormal test results. Recognition by healthcare professionals was 12\% in the group with 1 abnormal test and 44-64\% in the group with 2 abnormal test results. In our model, cognitive impairment predicted 12-month mortality with a hazard ratio (95\% CI) of 2.86 (1.28-6.39) for the group with 1 abnormal cognitive test and 3.39 (1.54-7.45) for the group with 2 abnormal test results. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment is frequent in medical inpatients and associated with increased mortality. Recognition rates of cognitive impairment need to be improved in hospitals.},

DESIGN/SETTING: Prospective observational study in New South Wales, Australia. SUBJECTS: 267,006 men and women aged 45 years and over. OUTCOME MEASURES: PPH admissions and mortality during follow-up according to individual positive health behaviours (non-smoking, {$<$}14 alcoholic drinks per week, {$\geq$} 2.5 hours of physical activity per week, {$\geq$} 2 servings of fruit and 5 servings of vegetables per day, {$<$}8 hours sitting and {$\geq$} 7 hours sleeping per day) and the total number of these behaviours. RESULTS: During an average of 3 years follow-up, 20971 (8\%) participants had at least one PPH admission. After adjusting for potential confounders, participants who reported all six positive health behaviours at baseline had 46\% lower risk of PPH admission (95\% CI 0.48-0.61), compared to those who reported having only one of these behaviours. Based on these risk estimates, approximately 29\% of PPH admissions in Australians aged 45 years and over were attributable to not adhering to the six health behaviours. Estimates were similar for acute, chronic and vaccine-preventable categories of PPH admissions. CONCLUSIONS: Individual and combined positive health behaviours were associated with lower risk of PPH admission. These findings suggest that there is a significant opportunity to reduce PPH by promoting healthy behaviours.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with maternal and neonatal sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: This systematic  review and meta-analysis used the PRISMA guideline on sepsis data in sub-Saharan  Africa. The bibliographic search was carried out on the following databases:  Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Library, African Index Medicus, and Google Scholar.  Additionally, the reference lists of the included studies were screened for  potentially relevant studies. The last search was conducted on 15 October 2022.  The Joanna Briggs Institute quality assessment checklist was applied for critical  appraisal. Estimates of the prevalence of maternal and neonatal sepsis were  pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis model. Heterogeneity between studies  was estimated using the Q statistic and the I2 statistic. The funnel plot and  Egger's regression test were used to assess the publication bias. RESULTS: A  total of 39 studies were included in our review: 32 studies on neonatal sepsis  and 7 studies on maternal sepsis. The overall pooled prevalence of maternal and  neonatal sepsis in Sub-Saharan Africa was 19.21\% (95\% CI, 11.46-26.97) and 36.02\%  (CI: 26.68-45.36), respectively. The meta-analyses revealed that Apgar score\,{$<$}\,7  (OR: 2.4, 95\% CI: 1.6-3.5), meconium in the amniotic fluid (OR: 2.9, 95\% CI:  1.8-4.5), prolonged rupture of membranes {$>$}12\,h (OR: 2.8, 95\% CI: 1.9-4.1), male  sex (OR: 1.2, 95\% CI: 1.1-1.4), intrapartum fever (OR: 2.4, 95\% CI: 1.5-3.7), and  history of urinary tract infection in the mother (OR: 2.7, 95\% CI: 1.4-5.2) are  factors associated with neonatal sepsis. Rural residence (OR: 2.3, 95\% CI:  1.01-10.9), parity (OR: 0.5, 95\% CI: 0.3-0.7), prolonged labor (OR: 3.4, 95\% CI:  1.6-6.9), and multiple digital vaginal examinations (OR: 4.4, 95\% CI: 1.3-14.3)  were significantly associated with maternal sepsis. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of  maternal and neonatal sepsis was high in sub-Saharan Africa. Multiple factors  associated with neonatal and maternal sepsis were identified. These factors could  help in the prevention and development of strategies to combat maternal and  neonatal sepsis. Given the high risk of bias and high heterogeneity, further  high-quality research is needed in the sub-Saharan African context, including a  meta-analysis of individual data.Systematic review registration: PROSPERO (ID:  CRD42022382050).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors for neonatal sepsis among neonates admitted to selected health facilities in the  Bamako district and Koulikoro region in Mali. DESIGN: This is a prospective  cross-sectional study. Data were analyses using bivariate and multivariate  logistic regression. SETTING: This facility-based study was conducted in four  health facilities consisting of two hospitals and two reference health centres in  Mali. PARTICIPANTS: The study participants comprised 795 randomly selected  neonates and their indexed mother. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of the  study was the prevalence of sepsis in the considered health facilities. The other  variables of interest were risk factors for sepsis. RESULTS: The prevalence of  neonatal sepsis among the study population was 21.00\%. More than 74\% of sepsis  cases were early onset ({$<$}72\,hours). Neonatal age {$<$}7\,days (AOR=2.79, 95\%\,CI 1.59  to 4.89, p=0.000), low birth weight {$<$}2500\,g (AOR=2.88, 95\%\,CI 1.41 to 5.86,  p=0.003), Apgar score {$<$}7 (AOR=4.03, 95\%\,CI 3.09 to 5.24, p=0.000), mother with no  education (AOR=2.24, 95\%\,CI 1.15 to 4.33, p=0.02), maternal fever (AOR=2.31,  95\%\,CI 1.53 to 3.53, p=0.000), prolonged rupture of membranes (AOR=1.87, 95\%\,CI  1.01 to 3.54, p=0.04) and prolonged labour (AOR=2, 95\%\,CI 1.03 to 3.88, p=0.04)  were significantly associated with neonatal sepsis. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of  sepsis in Mali is still high. Given the country's current security context, the  findings in this study can support prevention activities, particularly given the  limited resources available. It is essential to facilitate antenatal and  postnatal visits, to promote in-facility births and rigorous monitoring of  neonates at high risk of sepsis. Furthermore, it would be beneficial for future  research on neonatal sepsis to include neonates born at home.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Few malnutrition screening tests are validated in the elderly Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patient. AIM: Having previously established malnutrition as a cause of higher mortality in this population, we compared two screening tools in elderly patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: For this prospective study, 111 consecutive patients admitted to the ICU and {$>$} 65 years underwent the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), and the Geriatric Nutrition Risk Index (GNRI) screening tests. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Standard definition of malnutrition risk was taken as the gold standard to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the tools. The k statistic was calculated to measure the agreement between the tools. The Shrout classification was used to interpret its values. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients screened was 74.7 {\textpm} 8.4 (65-97 years). The standard definition, MUST and GNRI identified 52.2\%, 65.4\%, and 64.9\% to be malnourished, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the tests were 96.5\% computed tomography (CI) (87.9-99.5\%) and 72.3\% CI (57.5-84.5\%) for MUST and 89.5\% CI (75.2-96.7\%) and 55.0\% CI (75.2-96.9\%) for GNRI, respectively. Screening was not possible by GNRI and MUST tool in 31\% versus 4\% of patients, respectively. The agreement between the tools was moderate for Standard-MUST k = 0.65 and MUST-GNRI k = 0.60 and fair for Standard-GNRI k = 0.43. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of malnutrition is high among our patients as identified by all the tools. Both GNRI and MUST showed a high sensitivity with MUST showing a higher specificity and greater applicability.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Local tumor ablation (LTA) and expectant management (EM) represent competing treatment modalities for patients with small renal masses (SRMs) who are unfit for surgery. We examined the potential social discrepancies in the access of LTA and EM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1860 patients with cT1a kidney cancer who had undergone either LTA (n = 553) or EM (n = 1307) from 2000 to 2009 were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database. The baseline patient data (age, comorbidity status, defined as Charlson comorbidity index [CCI], and several sociodemographic variables) and tumor characteristics were examined. A multivariable analysis predicting access to LTA compared with EM was fitted. The subgroup analyses focused on patients aged {$>$}/= 75 years with a CCI of {$>$}/= 2. RESULTS: Compared with LTA patients, the EM patients were significantly older (median age, 78 vs. 77 years; P {$<$} .001), more frequently unmarried (43\% vs. 37\%; P = .02), more frequently of African-American ethnicity (14\% vs. 8\%; P = .005), and more frequently of low socioeconomic status (SES; 55\% vs. 46\%; P = .001). No differences were seen according to gender, population density, CCI, or tumor size. In a multivariable analysis predicting access to LTA over EM, older age, African-American ethnicity, male gender, low SES, and unmarried status were associated with lower access to LTA (P {$<$}/= .04 for all). In the subgroup of older and sicker patients, none of the previous sociodemographic characteristics represented barriers to LTA access (P {$>$}/= .1 for all). CONCLUSION: Sociodemographic characteristics might represent barriers to LTA access for patients with SRMs managed nonoperatively. However, these associations vanished when older and sicker patients were examined.},

The intervention group participated in a 10-session PBL health literacy program and the comparison group did not. Results showed that 6 months after the intervention, the intervention group had significantly fewer ER visits and hospitalizations than the comparison group. The intervention group reported a greater decrease in delaying/avoiding health care due to communication barriers. Although the intervention group showed improvement in health literacy, health empowerment and navigation self-efficacy, the differences were not statistically significant. The PBL health literacy program resulted in fewer ER visits and hospitalizations, and better health care access among immigrant women. Cognitive and psychological outcomes examined in the study appeared more difficult to change. The PBL health literacy program effectively improved health care utilization and reduced barriers to health care access among immigrant women in Taiwan.

  abstract = {AIMS: Health literacy has been recognized as a key construct associated with clinical outcomes; however, few studies have explored the mechanism underlying the association. The transtheoretical model (TTM) has long been considered a useful conceptualization in the process of intentional behavior change. Stages of change lies at the heart of the TTM as studies of change have found that people move through a series of stages when modifying behavior. This study focuses on the role of knowledge and stages of change (SOC) as serial mediators linking health literacy to glycemic control. METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, a total of 232 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in this study. Participants completed questionnaires for assessing health literacy, readiness to consume healthy foods, and a dietary knowledge test specific to diabetes. RESULTS: Low health literacy was significantly associated with worse glycemic control. Statistical evaluation supported the serial mediation model, in which knowledge and SOC formed a serial mediation chain that accounted for the indirect effect of health literacy on glycemic control. In other words, dietary knowledge significantly motivated participants to move into the later stages of behavior change, which in turn improved the outcome of glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the ordering of mediators in the pathway between health literacy and health outcome may be complex, help explain the conflicting results of the past, and form a basis for the development of interventions promoting self-management of diabetes through glycemic control.},

  abstract = {Older Chinese immigrants are a growing population in the United States who experience multiple healthcare communication barriers such as limited English proficiency and low health literacy. Each of these obstacles has been associated with poor health outcomes but less is known about their effects in combination. This study examined the association between healthcare communication barriers and self-rated health among older Chinese immigrants. Cross-sectional survey data were obtained from 705 Chinese American immigrants ages 50-75 living in San Francisco, California. Communication barriers examined included spoken English proficiency, medical interpreter needs, and health literacy in written health information. The study sample (81 \% females, mean age = 62) included 67 \% who spoke English poorly or not at all, 34 \% who reported needing a medical interpreter, and 37 \% who reported "often" or "always" needing assistance to read health information. Two-thirds reported poor self-rated health; many reported having access to racial-concordant (74 \%) and language-concordant (86 \%) healthcare services. Both poor spoken English proficiency and low health literacy were associated with poor self-rated health, independent of other significant correlates (unemployment, chronic health conditions, and having a primary doctor who was ethnic Chinese). Results revealed that spoken English proficiency and print health literacy are independent communication barriers that are directly associated with health status among elderly Chinese American immigrants. Access to racial- or language-concordant health care services did not appear to resolve these barriers. These findings underscore the importance of addressing both spoken and written healthcare communication needs among older Chinese American immigrants.},

Factors strongly associated with three dependent variables in the model were extracted based on permuation importance. We found that the strongest determinant of knowledge of antibiotics and AMR was education level. Knowledge of antibiotics was strongly associated with the frequency of internet use. Exposure to primary information was associated with motivation for appropriate behavioural changes. Improving the availability of primary information would be a beneficial intervention. Individuals lacking higher education and without opportunities to obtain primary information should be considered a target population for effective interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sepsis is the third most common cause of death among neonates, with about 225,000 newborns dying every year globally. Data concerning the microbial  etiology of neonatal sepsis and antimicrobial resistance profiles of its  causative agents are necessary to inform targeted and effective treatment and  prevention strategies. OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of newborns with  symptoms and signs of sepsis who had a positive blood culture, its bacterial  etiology, the antimicrobial resistance patterns as well as the factors associated  with culture-positivity and case fatality at Mulago national referral hospital in  Uganda. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 359 neonates with  symptoms and signs of sepsis who presented to the pediatric emergency care unit  of Mulago national referral hospital from mid-January to end of December 2018. We  performed blood culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and conducted  polymerase chain reaction to identify methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) isolates. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the  association between potential risk factors and culture-positive neonatal sepsis.  FINDINGS: Of the 359 neonates recruited, 46 (12.8\%; 95\% CI 9.5\%, 16.7\%) had a  positive blood culture. The predominant isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus  aureus in 29 (63.0\%), Escherichia coli in seven (15.2\%), and Klebsiella  pneumoniae in five (10.9\%). Of the 46 pathogens, 73.9\% were resistant to  ampicillin, 23.9\% to gentamicin and 8.7\% to ceftriaxone. We isolated MRSA from  the blood specimens of 19 (5.3\%) of the 359 neonates, while 3 (0.8\%) grew  extended spectrum beta lactamase producers. The case fatality risk among neonates  with neonatal sepsis was 9.5\% (95\% CI: 6.6\%, 13.0\%). Cesarean section delivery  was strongly associated with culture-positive sepsis (adjusted odds ratio 3.45,  95\% CI: 1.2, 10.1). CONCLUSION: One in eight neonates with clinical signs of  sepsis grew a likely causative bacterial pathogen. S. aureus was the main  pathogen isolated and a third of these isolates were MRSA. A significant  proportion of the isolated bacterial pathogens were resistant to the first and  second line antibiotics used for the treatment of neonatal sepsis. There is need  to revisit the current treatment guidelines for neonatal sepsis.},

Inter- and intra-rater reliabilities were highest for the Tuokko et al. method. The Tuokko and Shulman scoring procedures had the highest sensitivities and relatively low specificities. The Wolf-Klein procedure had relatively low sensitivities and high specificities. Estimated areas under receiver operating curves were relatively high for all scoring methods. However, the area under the curve for the Watson procedure was significantly lower than the other procedures. All claims to the utility of clock drawing for differentiating between normal persons over 64 years of age and those with dementia appear validated.},

METHODS: This was a descriptive study. The Health Literacy Scale of the European Union was filled out by all of the participants. Costs related to COPD were taken into account. RESULTS: Compared to health literacy, the total cost of health care and the cost of admission to the emergency room seemed to be higher for subjects with inadequate health literacy levels than for subjects with significant levels of illness (p\,=\,.05 and p\,=\,.006, respectively). As the number of comorbidities increased, total and emergency department admission costs increased (p\,{$<$}\,.001 and p\,=\,.003, respectively). There was a difference between GOLD stages according to total, pulmonary disease and emergency service costs. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it was determined that health literacy is an important factor affecting health expenditures with COPD subjects. With the improvement of health literacy, subjects are expected to reduce the overall cost burden of the disease.},

A more proactive, integrated, person-centred and community-based response to frailty is required.The British Geriatrics Society Fit for Frailty guideline is consensus best practice guidance for the management of frailty in community and outpatient settings.Recognition of frailtyThe BGS recommends that all encounters between health and social care staff and older people in community and outpatient settings should include an assessment for frailty. A gait speed {$<$}0.8m/s; a timed-up-and-go test {$>$}10s; and a score of =3 on the PRISMA 7 questionnaire can indicate frailty. The common clinical presentations of frailty (falls, delirium, sudden immobility) can also be used to indicate the possible presence of frailty.Management of frailty The BGS recommends an holistic medical review based on the principles of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) for all older people identified with frailty. This will: diagnose medical illnesses to optimise treatment; apply evidence-based medication review checklists (e.g. STOPP/START criteria); include discussion with older people and carers to define the impact of illness; work with the older person to create an individualised care and support plan.Screening for frailtyThe BGS does not recommend population screening for frailty using currently available instruments.},

  abstract = {Diabetes is a risk factor for an accelerated rate of cognitive decline and dementia. However, the relationship between cognitive function and the subsequent development of diabetes is unclear.We conducted a historical-prospective cohort study merging data collected at premilitary recruitment assessment with information collected at the Staff Periodic Examination Center of the Israeli Army Medical Corps. Included were men aged 25 years or older without a history of diabetes at the beginning of follow-up with available data regarding their general intelligence score (GIS), a comprehensive measure of cognitive function, at age 17 years.Among 35,500 men followed for a median of 5.5 years, 770 new cases of diabetes were diagnosed. After adjustment for age, participants in the lowest GIS category had a 2.6-fold greater risk for developing diabetes compared with those in the highest GIS category. In multivariable analysis adjusted for age, BMI, fasting plasma glucose, sociogenetic variables, and lifestyle risk factors, those in the lowest GIS category had a twofold greater risk for incident diabetes when compared with the highest GIS category (hazard ratio 2.1 [95\% CI 1.5--3.1]; P {$<$} 0.001). Additionally, participants in the lowest GIS category developed diabetes at a mean age of 39.5 {\textpm} 4.7 years and those in the highest GIS group at a mean age of 41.5 {\textpm} 5.1 years (P for comparison 0.042).This study demonstrates that in addition to a potential causal link between diabetes and enhanced cognitive decline, lower cognitive function at late adolescence is independently associated with an elevated risk for future diabetes.},

When an adjustment is made, there is a lot of misunderstanding regarding the way this should be done. Therefore, the aims of this educational paper are: 1) to explain different methods used to estimate treatment effects in RCTs, 2) to illustrate the different methods with a real life example and 3) to give an advise on how to analyse RCT data. Methods: Longitudinal analysis of covariance, repeated measures analysis in which also the baseline value is used as outcome and the analysis of changes were theoretically explained and applied to an example dataset investigating a systolic blood pressure lowering treatment. Results: It was shown that differences at baseline should be taken into account and that regular repeated measures analysis and regular analysis of changes did not adjust for the baseline differences between the groups and therefore lead to biased estimates of the treatment effect. In the real life example, due to the differences at baseline between the treatment and control group, the different methods lead to different estimates of the treatment effect. Conclusion: Regarding the analysis of RCT data, it is advised to use longitudinal analysis of covariance or a repeated measures analysis without the treatment variable, but with the interaction between treatment and time in the model.},

  abstract = {Background Improved blood-glucose control decreases the progression of diabetic microvascular disease, but the effect on macrovascular complications is unknown. There is concern that sulphonylureas may increase cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and that high insulin concentrations may enhance atheroma formation. We compared the effects of intensive blood-glucose control with either sulphonylurea or insulin and conventional treatment on the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes in a randomised controlled trial. Methods 3867 newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes, median age 54 years (IQR 48--60 years), who after 3 months' diet treatment had a mean of two fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations of 6{$\cdot$}1--15{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L were randomly assigned intensive policy with a sulphonylurea (chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or glipizide) or with insulin, or conventional policy with diet. The aim in the intensive group was FPG less than 6 mmol/L. In the conventional group, the aim was the best achievable FPG with diet alone; drugs were added only if there were hyperglycaemic symptoms or FPG greater than 15 mmol/L. Three aggregate endpoints were used to assess differences between conventional and intensive treatment: any diabetes-related endpoint (sudden death, death from hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, stroke, renal failure, amputation [of at least one digit], vitreous haemorrhage, retinopathy requiring photocoagulation, blindness in one eye, or cataract extraction); diabetes-related death (death from myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, and sudden death); all-cause mortality. Single clinical endpoints and surrogate subclinical endpoints were also assessed. All analyses were by intention to treat and frequency of hypoglycaemia was also analysed by actual therapy. Findings Over 10 years, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 7{$\cdot$}0\% (6{$\cdot$}2--8{$\cdot$}2) in the intensive group compared with 7{$\cdot$}9\% (6{$\cdot$}9--8{$\cdot$}8) in the conventional group---an 11\% reduction. There was no difference in HbA1c among agents in the intensive group. Compared with the conventional group, the risk in the intensive group was 12\% lower (95\% CI 1--21, p=0{$\cdot$}029) for any diabetes-related endpoint; 10\% lower (-11 to 27, p=0{$\cdot$}34) for any diabetes-related death; and 6\% lower (-10 to 20, p=0{$\cdot$}44) for all-cause mortality. Most of the risk reduction in the any diabetes-related aggregate endpoint was due to a 25\% risk reduction (7--40, p=0{$\cdot$}0099) in microvascular endpoints, including the need for retinal photocoagulation. There was no difference for any of the three aggregate endpoints between the three intensive agents (chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin). Patients in the intensive group had more hypoglycaemic episodes than those in the conventional group on both types of analysis (both p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). The rates of major hypoglycaemic episodes per year were 0{$\cdot$}7\% with conventional treatment, 1{$\cdot$}0\% with chlorpropamide, 1{$\cdot$}4\% with glibenclamide, and 1{$\cdot$}8\% with insulin. Weight gain was significantly higher in the intensive group (mean 2{$\cdot$}9 kg) than in the conventional group (p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}001), and patients assigned insulin had a greater gain in weight (4{$\cdot$}0 kg) than those assigned chlorpropamide (2{$\cdot$}6 kg) or glibenclamide (1{$\cdot$}7 kg). Interpretation Intensive blood-glucose control by either sulphonylureas or insulin substantially decreases the risk of microvascular complications, but not macrovascular disease, in patients with type 2 diabetes. None of the individual drugs had an adverse effect on cardiovascular outcomes. All intensive treatment increased the risk of hypoglycaemia.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy, and the associated adverse drug events such as non-adherence to prescriptions, is a common problem for elderly people living with multiple comorbidities. Deprescribing, i.e. the gradual withdrawal from medications with supervision by a healthcare professional, is regarded as a means of reducing adverse effects of multiple medications including non-adherence. This systematic review examines the evidence of deprescribing as an effective strategy for improving medication adherence amongst older, community dwelling adults. METHODS: A mixed methods review was undertaken. Eight bibliographic database and two clinical trials registers were searched between May and December 2017. Results were double screened in accordance with pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria related to polypharmacy, deprescribing and adherence in older, community dwelling populations. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used for quality appraisal and an a priori data collection instrument was used. For the quantitative studies, a narrative synthesis approach was taken. The qualitative data was analysed using framework analysis. Findings were integrated using a mixed methods technique. The review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA reporting statement. RESULTS: A total of 22 original studies were included, of which 12 were RCTs. Deprescribing with adherence as an outcome measure was identified in randomised controlled trials (RCTs), observational and cohort studies from 13 countries between 1996 and 2017. There were 17 pharmacy-led interventions; others were led by General Practitioners (GP) and nurses. Four studies demonstrated an overall reduction in medications of which all studies corresponded with improved adherence. A total of thirteen studies reported improved adherence of which 5 were RCTs. Adherence was reported as a secondary outcome in all but one study. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to show that deprescribing improves medication adherence. Only 13 studies (of 22) reported adherence of which only 5 were randomised controlled trials. Older people are particularly susceptible to non-adherence due to multi-morbidity associated with polypharmacy. Bio-psycho-social factors including health literacy and multi-disciplinary team interventions influence adherence. The authors recommend further study into the efficacy and outcomes of medicines management interventions. A consensus on priority outcome measurements for prescribed medications is indicated.

Sociologists have played a central role in establishing the link between social relationships and health outcomes, identifying explanations for this link, and discovering social variation (e.g., by gender and race) at the population level. Studies show that social relationships have short- and long-term effects on health, for better and for worse, and that these effects emerge in childhood and cascade throughout life to foster cumulative advantage or disadvantage in health.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality are increasing in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), possibly due to a combination of changing lifestyles and improved healthcare infrastructure to facilitate diagnosis. Unfortunately, a large proportion of CRC cases in these countries remain undiagnosed or are diagnosed at advanced stages, resulting in poor outcomes. Decreasing mortality trends in HICs are likely due to evidence-based screening and treatment approaches that are not widely available in LMICs. Formative research to identify emerging opportunities to implement appropriate screening and treatment programs in LMICs is, therefore, of growing importance. We sought to identify potential barriers and facilitators for future implementation of fecal immunochemical test (FIT)-based CRC screening in a public healthcare system in a middle-income country with increasing CRC incidence and mortality. METHODS: We performed a qualitative study with semi-structured individual and focus group interviews with different CRC screening stakeholders, including 30 lay people at average risk for CRC, 13 health care personnel from a local public clinic, and 7 endoscopy personnel from a cancer referral hospital. All interviews were transcribed verbatim for analysis. Data were analyzed using the constant comparison method, under the theoretical perspectives of the social ecological model (SEM), the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, and the health belief model. RESULTS: We identified barriers and facilitators for implementation of a FIT-based CRC screening program at several levels of the SEM. The main barriers in each of the SEM levels were as follows: (1) at the social context level: poverty, health literacy and lay beliefs related to gender, cancer, allopathic medicine, and religion; (2) at the health services organization level: a lack of CRC knowledge among health care personnel and the community perception of poor quality of health care; and (3) at the individual level: a lack of CRC awareness and therefore lack of risk perception, together with fear of participating in screening activities and finding out about a serious disease. The main facilitators perceived by the participants were CRC screening information and the free provision of screening tests. CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings suggest that multi-level CRC screening programs in middle-income countries such as Mexico should incorporate complementary strategies to address barriers and facilitators, such as (1) provision of free screening tests, (2) education of primary healthcare personnel, and (3) promotion of non-fear-based CRC screening messages to the target population, tailored to address common lay beliefs.},

We examined the joint associations of marital status and duration of cohabitation on self-reported intimate partner violence, substance use, and postpartum depression among childbearing women.             Methods. We analyzed data from the 2006--2007 Canadian Maternity Experiences Survey, a cross-sectional nationwide sample of 6421 childbearing women. Cohabiting women were married or nonmarried women living with a partner; noncohabiters were single, divorced, or separated women. We further categorized cohabiters by their duration of cohabitation ({$\leq$}\,2, 3--5, or {$>$}\,5 years). We used logistic regression to generate adjusted odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals.             Results. About 92\% of women were cohabiters. Compared with married women living with a husband more than 5 years, unmarried women cohabiting for 2 years or less were at higher odds of intimate partner violence (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\,=\,4.64; 95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,2.85, 7.56), substance use (AOR\,=\,5.36; 95\% CI\,=\,3.06, 9.39), and postpartum depression (AOR\,=\,1.87; 95\% CI\,=\,1.25, 2.80); these risk estimates declined with duration of cohabitation.             Conclusions. Research on maternal and child health would benefit from distinguishing between married and unmarried cohabiting women, and their duration of cohabitation.},

Through the ageing years, the older individual presents with diabetes-related and non-related comorbidities and complications, develops functional limitations and psychological issues, and may lack social support and access to care. A disturbance in these categories, known as the four geriatric domains, will negatively affect diabetes self-management and self-efficacy, leading to poor outcomes and complications. Furthermore, older people with diabetes may be more interested in the management of other chronic conditions such as pain or impaired mobility, and diabetes may be lower in their list of priorities. Proper education must be provided to the older individual and caregivers, with continuous monitoring and counselling, especially when pharmacological interventions offer risks of side effects, adverse reactions and interactions with other medications. Informed shared medical decisions will help to improve adherence to the regimen; however, such discussions ought to be based on the best evidence available, which is unfortunately limited in this age group. We performed a review focused on pharmacological agents and summarize current evidence on their use for the treatment of diabetes in older people. We encourage clinicians to investigate and incorporate the four geriatrics domains in the selection and monitoring of these agents.},

Many admissions and readmissions may be avoidable, so that alternative strategies are needed to improve long-term management. METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial of the effect of a guideline-based intervention on rates of readmission within 90 days of hospital discharge and costs of care for patients who were hospitalized due to decompensated heart failure. The intervention consisted of comprehensive education of the patient and family, a prescribed diet and intensive application of guidelines' recommendations on pharmacological therapy. The intervention started before discharge and continued thereafter with follow-up visits for up to 3 months. Two hundred and nine guideline-managed patients were compared to 209 concurrent normally-discharged patients. RESULTS: Patients in the study group were more prescribed beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and spironolactone. Sixteen patients (8\%) in the intervention group and 31 (15\%) among controls were readmitted for DRG 127, within 3 months of discharge (Fisher's exact test, p {$<$} 0.01), while the 6-month mortality rate was similar between groups (9 and 11.5\% respectively). Quality of life significantly improved from 5.6 +/- 1.0 to 6.1 +/- 1.9 (Mann-Whitney U-test, p {$<$} 0.05). The overall costs of care were lower for guideline-managed patients (110 vs 150 Euro per patient per month), due to the lower readmission rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that a guideline-based management program for patients with heart failure at discharge improves quality of life and reduces readmission for DRG 127 and total bed days, allowing relevant cost savings.},

Further results are given that allow for assessing the range of times and baseline survival probabilities for which parameter estimates indicate that a causal interaction is present, and for deriving lower bounds on the prevalence of such causal interactions. An interesting feature of the time-to-event setting is that causal interactions can disappear as time progresses i.e. whether a causal interaction is present depends on the follow-up time. The results are illustrated by hypothetical and data analysis examples.},

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the measurement properties (ie, structural validity of the construct and internal consistency) of the CAPACITY instrument in care partners of patients with cognitive impairment, and to examine whether care partner health literacy and patient cognitive impairment are associated with a higher or lower CAPACITY score. RESEARCH DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study. SUBJECTS: A total of 1746 dyads of community-dwelling care partners and older adults in the United States with cognitive impairment who obtained an amyloid positron emission tomography scan. MEASURES: The CAPACITY instrument comprises 12 items that can be combined as a total score or examined as subdomain scores about communication with the team and care partner capacity-assessment by the team. The 2 covariates of primary interest in the regression model are health literacy and level of cognitive impairment of the patient (Modified Telephone Interview Cognitive Status). RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis showed the CAPACITY items fit the expected 2-factor structure (communication and capacity). Higher cognitive functioning of patients and higher health literacy among care partners was associated with lower communication domain scores, lower capacity domain scores, and lower overall CAPACITY scores. CONCLUSIONS: The strong psychometric validity of the CAPACITY measure indicates it could have utility in other family caregivers or care partner studies assessing the quality of interactions with clinical teams. Knowing that CAPACITY differs by care partner health literacy and patient impairment level may help health care teams employ tailored strategies to achieve high-quality care partner interactions.},

The unpredictable disease course causes much uncertainty and anxiety among patients and relatives. Improved disease knowledge may result in better health outcomes. In PSC, there is lack of high quality patient education materials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of a 3-dimensional education video to improve PSC knowledge in patients and relatives. METHODS: A digital survey containing questions about PSC, anxiety and satisfaction was sent prior to, directly after, and one week after watching the video. Both European and American patients and relatives were included. RESULTS: A total of 278 participants (224 patients and 54 relatives) were included. PSC knowledge score increased from 53 \% to 74 \% directly after and 70 \% one week after the video. The STAI anxiety score decreased after the video (-0,8, p\,=\,0,007). Younger age and lower baseline knowledge were independent predictors of knowledge improvement. CONCLUSION: Disease knowledge improved after watching the video and this was sustained one week later. Generally, patients were very enthusiastic about the video. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: 3D education videos can be useful to increase disease knowledge in a severe disease such as PSC.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness of case finding of patients at risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, whether the method is suitable for use in general practice, how patients should be selected, and the time required. DESIGN: Cross sectional study. SETTING: Two semirural general practices in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 651 smokers aged 35 to 70 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Short standardised questionnaire on bronchial symptoms for current smokers, lung function with a spirometer, and the quality of the spirometric curve. RESULTS: Of the 201 smokers not taking drugs for a pulmonary condition, 169 produced an acceptable curve (fulfilling American Thoracic Society criteria). Of these, 30 (18\%, 95\% confidence interval 12\% to 24\%) had a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) {$<$}80\% of predicted. When smokers were preselected on the basis of chronic cough, the proportion with an FEV(1) {$<$}80\% of predicted increased to 27\% (17 of 64; 12\% to 38\%). Chronic cough was a better predictor of airflow obstruction than other symptoms, such as wheeze and dyspnoea. The presence of two symptoms was a slightly better predictor than cough only (odds ratio 3.02 (1.37 to 6.64) v 2.50 (1.14 to 5.52)). Age was also a good predictor of obstruction; smokers over 60 with cough had a 48\% chance of having an obstruction. The mean time needed for spirometry was four minutes. Detecting one smoker with an FEV(1) {$<$}80\% of predicted cost 5 pound sterling to 10 pound sterling. CONCLUSIONS: Trained practice assistants could check all patients who smoke for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at little cost to the practice. Cough and age are the most important predictors of the disease. By testing one smoker a day, an average practice could identify one patient at risk a week.},

  abstract = {Background: Readmissions to hospital are common, costly and often preventable. An easy-to-use index to quantify the risk of readmission or death after discharge from hospital would help clinicians identify patients who might benefit from more intensive post-discharge care. We sought to derive and validate an index to predict the risk of death or unplanned readmission within 30 days after discharge from hospital to the community. Methods: In a prospective cohort study, 48 patient-level and admission-level variables were collected for 4812 medical and surgical patients who were discharged to the community from 11 hospitals in Ontario. We used a split-sample design to derive and validate an index to predict the risk of death or nonelective readmission within 30 days after discharge. This index was externally validated using administrative data in a random selection of 1 000 000 Ontarians discharged from hospital between 2004 and 2008. Results: Of the 4812 participating patients, 385 (8.0\%) died or were readmitted on an unplanned basis within 30 days after discharge. Variables independently associated with this outcome (from which we derived the nmemonic ``LACE'') included length of stay (``L''); acuity of the admission (``A''); comorbidity of the patient (measured with the Charlson comorbidity index score) (``C''); and emergency department use (measured as the number of visits in the six months before admission) (``E''). Scores using the LACE index ranged from 0 (2.0\% expected risk of death or urgent readmission within 30 days) to 19 (43.7\% expected risk). The LACE index was discriminative (C statistic 0.684) and very accurate (Hosmer--Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic 14.1, p = 0.59) at predicting outcome risk. Interpretation: The LACE index can be used to quantify risk of death or unplanned readmission within 30 days after discharge from hospital. This index can be used with both primary and administrative data. Further research is required to determine whether such quantification changes patient care or outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Urgent, unplanned hospital readmissions are increasingly being used to gauge the quality of care. We reviewed urgent readmissions to determine which were potentially avoidable and compared rates of all-cause and avoidable readmissions. METHODS: In a multicentre, prospective cohort study, we reviewed all urgent readmissions that occurred within six months among patients discharged to the community from 11 teaching and community hospitals between October 2002 and July 2006. Summaries of the readmissions were reviewed by at least four practising physicians using standardized methods to judge whether the readmission was an adverse event (poor clinical outcome due to medical care) and whether the adverse event could have been avoided. We used a latent class model to determine whether the probability that each readmission was truly avoidable exceeded 50\%. RESULTS: Of the 4812 patients included in the study, 649 (13.5\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 12.5\%-14.5\%) had an urgent readmission within six months after discharge. We considered 104 of them (16.0\% of those readmitted, 95\% CI 13.3\%-19.1\%; 2.2\% of those discharged, 95\% CI 1.8\%-2.6\%) to have had a potentially avoidable readmission. The proportion of patients who had an urgent readmission varied significantly by hospital (range 7.5\%-22.5\%; {$\chi$}(2) = 92.9, p {$<$} 0.001); the proportion of readmissions deemed avoidable did not show significant variation by hospital (range 1.2\%-3.7\%; {$\chi$}(2) = 12.5, p {$<$} 0.25). We found no association between the proportion of patients who had an urgent readmission and the proportion of patients who had an avoidable readmission (Pearson correlation 0.294; p = 0.38). In addition, we found no association between hospital rankings by proportion of patients readmitted and rankings by proportion of patients with an avoidable readmission (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.28, p = 0.41). INTERPRETATION: Urgent readmissions deemed potentially avoidable were relatively uncommon, comprising less than 20\% of all urgent readmissions following hospital discharge. Hospital-specific proportions of patients who were readmitted were not related to proportions with a potentially avoidable readmission.},

However, this approach is valid only when we know what proportion of readmissions are avoidable. We conducted a systematic review of studies that measured the proportion of readmissions deemed avoidable. We examined how such readmissions were measured and estimated their prevalence. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases to identify all studies published from 1966 to July 2010 that reviewed hospital readmissions and that specified how many were classified as avoidable. RESULTS: Our search strategy identified 34 studies. Three of the studies used combinations of administrative diagnostic codes to determine whether readmissions were avoidable. Criteria used in the remaining studies were subjective. Most of the studies were conducted at single teaching hospitals, did not consider information from the community or treating physicians, and used only one reviewer to decide whether readmissions were avoidable. The median proportion of readmissions deemed avoidable was 27.1\% but varied from 5\% to 79\%. Three study-level factors (teaching status of hospital, whether all diagnoses or only some were considered, and length of follow-up) were significantly associated with the proportion of admissions deemed to be avoidable and explained some, but not all, of the heterogeneity between the studies. INTERPRETATION: All but three of the studies used subjective criteria to determine whether readmissions were avoidable. Study methods had notable deficits and varied extensively, as did the proportion of readmissions deemed avoidable. The true proportion of hospital readmissions that are potentially avoidable remains unclear.},

Hospitals that measure the proportion of urgent readmissions judged avoidable need to know previously published rates for comparison. In this study, we generated a literature-based estimate for the proportion of 30-day urgent readmissions deemed avoidable for hospitals to use to gauge their performance in avoidable readmissions.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: We searched the Medline and Embase databases to identify published studies that reported the proportion of 30-day urgent readmissions deemed avoidable. We then modelled the overall proportion of 30-day urgent readmissions deemed avoidable.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We included 16 studies that used a wide variety of patients and a diverse range of methods to classify readmissions as avoidable. Studies reported a broad range for the proportion of urgent 30-day readmissions deemed avoidable. Overall, 848 of 3669 readmissions (23.1\%, 95\% confidence interval, 21.7-24.5) of 30-day urgent readmissions were classified as avoidable. This proportion varied significantly based on hospital teaching status and number of reviewers for each case [teaching hospitals: with one reviewer, 9.3\% (4.2-19.3); with {$>$}1 reviewer, 21.6\% (13.2-33.3); non-teaching hospital: with one reviewer, 32.2\% (11.4-63.9); with {$>$}1 reviewer, 39.9\% (37.6-42.2)]. Significant heterogeneity remained between studies even after clustering studies by these covariates.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Less than one in four readmissions were deemed avoidable. Health system planners need to use caution in interpreting all cause readmission statistics as they are only partially influenced by quality of care.},

Therefore, only a component of all hospital readmissions can be influenced by interventions designed to decrease them. In this study, we determined how effective interventions must be to attain specific reductions in hospital readmission rates. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A conceptual model of all readmissions and potentially avoidable readmissions was used to derive a mathematical relationship between the relative reduction in the total number of readmissions, the relative reduction in potentially avoidable readmissions, and the proportion of readmissions that are potentially avoidable. RESULTS: When 22\% of readmissions were potentially avoidable, achieving a 20\% reduction in the total number of readmissions required a 91\% reduction in potentially avoidable readmissions; decreasing potentially avoidable readmissions by 20\% reduced total readmissions by 4.4\%. CONCLUSION: These results highlight that relative reductions in the total number of readmissions are notably lower than that for potentially avoidable readmissions. This separation in relative reduction of all and potentially avoidable readmissions increases as the proportion of readmissions deemed potentially avoidable decreases. These results have important implications for health care planners and researchers.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To assess preferences, participants (n\,=\,219\,{$<$}\,65 and n\,=\,227{$>$}65) were exposed to a storyboard presenting six types of graphs. Understanding (verbatim and gist knowledge) was assessed in an experiment using a 6 (graphs: clock, bar, sparkplug, table, pie vs pictograph) by 2 (age: younger [{$<$}65] vs older [{$>$}65]) between-subjects design. RESULTS: Most participants preferred clock, pie or bar chart. Pie was not well understood by both younger and older people, and clock not by older people. Bar was fairly well understood in both groups. Table yielded high knowledge scores, particularly in the older group. Lower age, higher numeracy and higher graph literacy contributed to higher verbatim knowledge scores. Higher health literacy and graph literacy were associated with higher gist knowledge. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Although not the preferred format, tables are best understood by older adults. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Graph literacy skills are essential for both verbatim and gist understanding, and are important to take into account when developing risk information.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Globally, over 400,000 neonatal deaths in 2015 were attributed to sepsis, however, the incidence and etiologies of these infections are largely  unknown in low-middle income countries. We aimed to determine incidence and  etiology of community-acquired early-onset ({$<$}72 hours age) sepsis (EOS) using  culture and molecular diagnostics. METHODS: This was a prospective observational  study, in which we conducted a surveillance for pathogens using a combination of  blood culture and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test. Blood culture was  performed on all neonates with suspected EOS. Among the subset fulfilling  criteria for protocol-defined EOS, blood and nasopharyngeal (NP) respiratory  swabs were tested by quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR using a  Taqman Array Card (TAC) with 15 bacterial and 12 viral targets. Blood and NP  samples from 312 healthy newborns were also tested by TAC to estimate background  positivity rates. We used variant latent-class methods to attribute etiologies  and calculate pathogen-specific proportions and incidence rates. RESULTS: We  enrolled 2,624 neonates with suspected EOS and from these 1,231 newborns met  criteria for protocol-defined EOS (incidence- 39.3/1,000 live-births). Using the  partially latent-class modelling, only 26.7\% cases with protocol-defined EOS had  attributable etiology, and the largest pathogen proportion were Ureaplasma spp.  (5.4\%; 95\%CI: 3.6-8.0) and group B Streptococcus (GBS) (4.8\%; 95\%CI: 4.1-5.8),  and no etiology was attributable for 73.3\% of cases. Blood cultures were positive  in 99/1,231 (8.0\%) with protocol-defined EOS (incidence- 3.2/1,000 live-births).  Leading pathogens on blood culture included GBS (35\%) and viridans streptococci  (24\%). Ureaplasma spp. was the most common organism identified on TAC among cases  with protocol-defined EOS. CONCLUSION: Using a combination of blood culture and a  PCR-based test the common pathogens isolated in neonates with sepsis were  Ureaplasma spp. and GBS. Despite documenting higher rates of protocol-defined EOS  and using a combination of tests, the etiology for EOS remains elusive.},

  abstract = {Building on prior conceptual schemes, this article presents a sociomedical model of disability, called The Disablement Process, that is especially useful for epidemiological and clinical research. The Disablement Process: (1) describes how chronic and acute conditions affect functioning in specific body systems, generic physical and mental actions, and activities of daily life, and (2) describes the personal and environmental factors that speed or slow disablement, namely, risk factors, interventions, and exacerbators. A main pathway that links Pathology, Impairments, Functional Limitations, and Disability is explicated. Disability is defined as difficulty doing activities in any domain of life (from hygiene to hobbies, errands to sleep) due to a health or physical problem. Feedback effects are included in the model to cover dysfunction spirals (pernicious loops of dysfunction) and secondary conditions (new pathology launched by a given disablement process). We distinguish intrinsic disability (without personal or equipment assistance) and actual disability (with such assistance), noting the scientific and political importance of measuring both. Disability is not a personal characteristic, but is instead a gap between personal capability and environmental demand. Survey researchers and clinicians tend to focus on personal capability, overlooking the efforts people commonly make to reduce demand by activity accommodations, environmental modifications, psychological coping, and external supports. We compare the disablement experiences of people who acquire chronic conditions early in life (lifelong disability) and those who acquire them in mid or late life (late-life disability). The Disablement Process can help inform research (the epidemiology of disability) and public health (prevention of disability) activities.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis in women in general practice and to assess risk factors associated with infection. METHODS The study was carried out in 2001-2 in different general practices in Antwerp, Belgium. Sexually active women, visiting their general practitioner for routine gynaecological care (mostly pill prescription or PAP smear), were offered opportunistic screening for chlamydia. 787 participants aged 15-40 delivered a self taken vaginal sample and filled in a questionnaire which included questions on demographic variables, urogenital symptoms, sexual history, and sexual behaviour. Samples were tested for presence of chlamydial DNA by means of a ligase chain reaction (LCR) assay, and positives were confirmed by two other amplification assays (PCR and SDA). RESULTS Overall prevalence was 5.0\% (95\% CI: 3.5 to 6.5). Determinants of infection in logistic regression analysis were age 18-27 years, {$>$}1 partner in the past year, no use of contraceptives, frequent postcoital bleeding, having a symptomatic partner, painful micturition, and living in the inner city. The area under the ROC curve in the full model was 0.88. Selective screening based on a combination of the five first determinants detects 92.3\% of infections in this sample; 37.5\% of the population would need to be screened. CONCLUSION Targeted screening for chlamydial infection is possible, even in a heterogeneous group of general practice attendants. Implementing this model would require considerable communication skills from healthcare providers.}

  abstract = {Low compliance to prescribed medical interventions is an ever present and complex problem, especially for patients with a chronic illness. With increasing numbers of medications shown to do more good than harm when taken as prescibed, low compliance is a major problem in health care. Relevant studies were retrieved through comprehensive searches of different database systems to enable a thorough assessment of the major issues in compliance to prescribed medical interventions. The term compliance is the main term used in this review because the majority of papers reviewed used this term. Three decades have passed since the first workshop on compliance research. It is timely to pause and to reflect on the accumulated knowledge. The enormous amount of quantitative research undertaken is of variable methodological quality, with no gold standard for the measurement of compliance and it is often not clear which type of non-compliance is being studied. Many authors do not even feel the need to define adherence. Often absent in the research on compliance is the patient, although the concordance model points at the importance of the patient's agreement and harmony in the doctor-patient relationship. The backbone of the concordance model is the patient as a decision maker and a cornerstone is professional empathy. Recently, some qualitative research has identified important issues such as the quality of the doctor-patient relationship and patient health beliefs in this context. Because non-compliance remains a major health problem, more high quality studies are needed to assess these aspects and systematic reviews/meta-analyses are required to study the effects of compliance in enhancing the effects of interventions.},

Worldwide, one in four men and one in five women are hypertensive. For effective preventive strategy, understanding of predictors of hypertension is necessary. Objective: To assess prevalence and predictors of hypertension in the rural adult Indian population. Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 425 rural subjects (25--64 years) of the Varanasi district in India selected through multistage sampling. Blood pressure of each subject was measured using a standard technique. Sociodemographic data and predictors of hypertension were assessed by interviewing subjects with help of a predesigned and pretested proforma. Results: Prevalence of hypertension was 31.5\% (95\% CI: 27.1--35.9). There existed a significant (P {$<$} 0.05) association of BP with age, educational status, occupation, socioeconomic class, tobacco consumption, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, and nutritional status. No significant association was found with gender, religion, caste, marital status, type and size of family, family without NCDs, awareness of screening camps for NCDs and national program for prevention and control of cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and stroke, and alcohol consumption. Significant association of education, nutritional, and occupational status obtained in univariate analysis got eliminated in the logistic model. Risk of hypertension was higher in the 45--64 years age group (AOR: 3.06; 95\% CI: 1.75--5.35) and in socioeconomic class IV and V (AOR: 2.24; 95\% CI: 1.17--4.31). Conclusion: Prevalence of hypertension in the rural population was high and most of the observed predictors were modifiable.},

This article defines the problem of health literacy and provides useful information for case managers to better understand the scope of the problem and strategies for working with patients to ensure good communication. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING(S): All settings. FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: Raising awareness of the scope of low literacy among patients is critical for any practice. Implementing basic practices to ensure effective communication will increase the likelihood of patient compliance and successful outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: Keep key messages to patients to a minimum. Use the teach-back method with patients to ensure that they understand their care regimen and warning signs. Never ask, " Do you understand?" Ask patients to explain processes. Have your written patient education materials reviewed by a literacy expert to determine grade reading level. Materials should not be above a fifth-grade level, and should be culturally appropriate.},

Congestive heart failure, one of the most common indications for hospitalization in the elderly, is also associated with a high incidence of early rehospitalization, but variables identifying patients at increased risk and an analysis of potentially remediable factors contributing to readmission have not previously been reported. We prospectively evaluated 161 patients 70 years or older that had been hospitalized with documented congestive heart failure. Hospital mortality was 13\% (n = 21). Among patients discharged alive, 66 (47\%) were readmitted within 90 days. Recurrent heart failure was the most common cause for readmission, occurring in 38 patients (57\%). Other cardiac disorders accounted for five readmissions (8\%), and noncardiac illness led to readmission in 21 cases (32\%). Factors predictive of an increased probability of readmission included a prior history of heart failure, four or more admissions within the preceding 8 years, and heart failure precipitated by an acute myocardial infarction or uncontrolled hypertension (all P less than .05). Using subjective criteria, 25 first readmissions (38\%) were judged possibly preventable, and 10 (15\%) were judged probably preventable. Factors contributing to preventable readmissions included noncompliance with medications (15\%) or diet (18\%), inadequate discharge planning (15\%) or follow-up (20\%), failed social support system (21\%), and failure to seek medical attention promptly when symptoms recurred (20\%). Thus, early rehospitalization in elderly patients with congestive heart failure may be preventable in up to 50\% of cases, identification of high risk patients is possible shortly after admission, and further study of nonpharmacologic interventions designed to reduce readmission frequency is justified.},

Our aim was to determine whether low leg muscle mass and greater fat infiltration in the muscle were associated with poor lower extremity performance (LEP). DESIGN: A cross-sectional study, using baseline data of the Health, Aging and Body Composition study (1997/98). SETTING: Medicare beneficiaries residing in ZIP codes from the metropolitan areas surrounding Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Memphis, Tennessee. PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand seventy-five well-functioning black and white men and women aged 70 to 79. MEASUREMENTS: Two timed tests (6-meter walk and repeated chair stands) were used to measure LEP. Muscle cross-sectional area and muscle tissue attenuation (indicative of fat infiltration) were obtained from computed tomography scans at the midthigh. Body fat was assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Blacks had greater muscle mass and poorer LEP than whites. Black women had greater fat infiltration into the muscle than white women. After adjustment for clinic site, age, height, and total body fat, smaller muscle area was associated with poorer LEP in all four race-gender groups. (Regression coefficients, expressed per standard deviation (+/-55 cm2) of muscle area, were 0.658 and 0.519 in white and black men and 0.547 and 0.435 in white and black women, respectively, P {$<$}.01.) In addition, reduced muscle attenuation-indicative of greater fat infiltration into the muscle-was associated with poorer LEP, independent of total body fat and muscle area. (Regression coefficients per standard deviation (= 7 Hounsfield Units) of muscle attenuation were 0.292 and 0.224 in white and black men, and 0.193 and 0.159 in white and black women, respectively, P {$<$}.05). The most important body composition components related to LEP were muscle area in men and total body fat in women. Results were similar after additional adjustment for lifestyle factors and health status. No interactions between race and muscle area (P{$>$}.7) or between race and muscle attenuation (P{$>$}.2) were observed. CONCLUSION: Smaller midthigh muscle area and greater fat infiltration in the muscle are associated with poorer LEP in well-functioning older men and women.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported that African Americans are more likely than whites to prefer aggressive treatments at the end of life. OBJECTIVE: Since the medical information presented to subjects is frequently complex, we hypothesized that apparent differences in end-of-life preferences and decision making may be due to disparities in health literacy. A video of a patient with advanced dementia may overcome communication barriers associated with low health literacy. DESIGN: Before and after oral survey. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects presenting to their primary care doctors. METHODS: Subjects were asked their preferences for end-of-life care after they heard a verbal description of advanced dementia. Subjects then viewed a 2-minute video of a patient with advanced dementia and were asked again about their preferences. For the analysis, preferences were dichotomized into comfort care and aggressive care. Health literacy was measured using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and subjects were divided into three literacy categories: low (0-45, sixth grade and below), marginal (46-60, seventh to eighth grade) and adequate (61-66, ninth grade and above). Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were fit using stepwise algorithms to examine factors related to initial preferences before the video. RESULTS: A total of 80 African Americans and 64 whites completed the interview. In unadjusted analyses, African Americans were more likely than whites to have preferences for aggressive care after the verbal description, odds ratio (OR) 4.8 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.1-10.9). Subjects with low or marginal health literacy were also more likely than subjects with adequate health literacy to have preferences for aggressive care after the verbal description, OR 17.3 (95\% CI 6.0-49.9) and OR 11.3 (95\% CI 4.2-30.8) respectively. In adjusted analyses, health literacy (low health literacy: OR 7.1, 95\% CI 2.1-24.2; marginal health literacy OR 5.1, 95\% CI 1.6-16.3) but not race (OR 1.1, 95\% CI 0.3-3.2) was an independent predictor of preferences after the verbal description. After watching a video of advanced dementia, there were no significant differences in the distribution of preferences by race or health literacy. CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy and not race was an independent predictor of end-of-life preferences after hearing a verbal description of advanced dementia. In addition, after viewing a video of a patient with advanced dementia there were no longer any differences in the distribution of preferences according to race and health literacy. These findings suggest that clinical practice and research relating to end-of-life preferences may need to focus on a patient education model incorporating the use of decision aids such as video to ensure informed decision-making.},

Public knowledge is considered a prerequisite for appropriate use of antibiotics and limited spread of antibiotic resistance. Our aim was to examine the level of knowledge of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance among Norwegian pharmacy customers, and to assess to which degree beliefs, attitudes and sociodemographic factors are associated with this knowledge. METHODS: A questionnaire based, cross-sectional study was conducted among pharmacy customers in three Norwegian cities. The questionnaire covered 1) knowledge of antibiotics (13 statements) and antibiotic resistance (10 statements), 2) the general beliefs about medicines questionnaire (BMQ general) (three subdomains, four statements each), 3) attitudes toward antibiotic use (four statements), and 4) sociodemographic factors, life style and health. High knowledge level was defined as {$>$} 66\% of maximum score. Factors associated with knowledge of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance were investigated through univariate and multiple linear regression. Hierarchical model regression was used to estimate a population average knowledge score weighted for age, gender and level of education. RESULTS: Among 877 participants, 57\% had high knowledge of antibiotics in general and 71\% had high knowledge of antibiotic resistance. More than 90\% knew that bacteria can become resistant against antibiotics and that unnecessary use of antibiotics can make them less effective. Simultaneously, more than 30\% erroneously stated that antibiotics are effective against viruses, colds or influenza. Factors positively associated with antibiotic knowledge were health professional background, high education level, and a positive view on the value of medications in general. Male gender, a less restrictive attitude toward antibiotic use, and young age were negatively associated with antibiotic knowledge. The mean overall antibiotic knowledge score was relatively high (15.6 out of maximum 23 with estimated weighted population score at 14.8). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a high level of knowledge of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance among Norwegian pharmacy customers, there are obvious knowledge gaps. We suggest that action is taken to increase the knowledge level, and particularly target people in vocational, male dominated occupations outside the health service, and primary/secondary school curricula.},

It is, however, unclear how adverse socioeconomic conditions (SEC) at different periods of the life course predict the occurrence of multimorbidity in later life.

We identified four studies (25,209 participants) with the first measure of SEC in childhood (before age 18). In these four studies, childhood SEC was associated with multimorbidity in old age, and the associations were partially or fully attenuated upon adjustment for later-life SEC. These results are consistent with the sensitive period and the pathway models. We identified five studies (91,236 participants) with the first measure of SEC in young adulthood (after age 18), and the associations with multimorbidity in old age as well as the effects of adjustment for later-life SEC differed from one study to the other. Among the nine included studies, none tested the social mobility or the accumulation models. In conclusion, SEC in early life could have an effect on multimorbidity, attenuated at least partly by SEC in adulthood.},

  abstract = {Purpose Children who are hard of hearing (CHH) tend to have reduced vocabularies compared to children with normal hearing (CNH). Prior research on vocabulary skills in children with hearing loss has focused primarily on their breadth of knowledge (how many words are known). Depth of vocabulary knowledge (how well words are known) is not well documented for CHH. The current study used linear mixed models (LMMs) to investigate growth trajectories of vocabulary depth and breadth in CHH relative to age-matched CNH. Method Participants for this study included 155 children (93 CHH, 62 CNH) enrolled in a longitudinal study. Examiners administered a standardized measure of vocabulary knowledge at ages 7, 8, and 9 years. We constructed multiple LMMs with fixed effects for group and age. The models included various combinations of random intercepts for subject and item and random slope for age. Results For depth, CHH showed significant and stable deficits compared to CNH over time. For breadth, CNH showed greater vocabulary breadth, but the group differences diminished with age. For CHH, higher aided audibility, age, and maternal educational level were associated with greater vocabulary breadth and depth. Age at hearing aid fitting was not. Conclusions A major advantage of using LMM is that it allowed us to cope with missing data points while still accounting for variability within and across participants. Assessment of both vocabulary breadth and depth may be useful in identifying school-age CHH who are at risk of delays in language outcomes.},

Unplanned hospital admissions for ill-defined conditions (coded with an R prefix within Chapter XVIII of the International Classification of Diseases-10) have been targeted for admission avoidance strategies, but little is known about these admissions. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and factors predicting ill-defined (R-coded) hospital admissions of older people and their association with health outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of unplanned hospital admissions to general internal and geriatric medicine wards in one hospital over 12 months (2002) with follow-up for 36 months. The study was carried out in an acute teaching hospital in England. The participants were all people aged 65 and over with unplanned hospital admissions to general internal and geriatric medicine. Independent variables included time of admission, residence at admission, route of admission to hospital, age, gender, comorbidity measured by count of diagnoses. Main outcome measures were primary diagnosis (ill-defined versus other diagnostic code), death during the hospital stay, deaths to 36 months, readmissions within 36 months, discharge destination and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Incidence of R-codes at discharge was 21.6\%, but was higher in general internal than geriatric medicine (25.6\% v 14.1\% respectively). Age, gender and co-morbidity were not significant predictors of R-code diagnoses. Admission via the emergency department (ED), out of normal general practitioner (GP) hours, under the care of general medicine and from non-residential care settings increased the risk of receiving R-codes. R-coded patients had a significantly shorter length of stay (5.91 days difference, 95\% CI 4.47, 7.35), were less likely to die (hazard ratio 0.71, 95\%CI 0.59, 0.85) at any point, but were as likely to be readmitted as other patients (hazard ratio 0.96 (95\% CI 0.88, 1.05). CONCLUSIONS: R-coded diagnoses accounted for 1/5 of emergency admission episodes, higher than anticipated from total English hospital admissions, but comparable with rates reported in similar settings in other countries. Unexpectedly, age did not predict R-coded diagnosis at discharge. Lower mortality and length of stay support the view that these are avoidable admissions, but readmission rates particularly for further R-coded admissions indicate on-going health care needs. Patient characteristics did not predict R-coding, but organisational features, particularly admission via the ED, out of normal GP hours and via general internal medicine, were important and may offer opportunity for admission reduction strategies.},

METHODS: Three steps were undertaken to identify family history tools for evaluation: (a) Internet searches, (b) expert consultation, and (c) literature searches. Tools identified were assessed for readability using the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) readability formula. The complexity of documents (i.e., forms collecting family history information) was assessed using the PMOSE/IKIRSCH document readability formula. RESULTS: A total of 78 tools were identified, 47 of which met the criteria for inclusion. SMOG reading grade levels for multimedia-based tools ranged from 10.1 to 18.3, with an average score of 13.6. For print-based tools, SMOG ranged from 8.7 to 14.1, with an average score of 12.0. Document complexity ranged from very low complexity (level 1 proficiency) to high complexity (level 4 proficiency). CONCLUSION: The majority of tools are written at a reading grade level that is beyond the 8th grade average reading level in the United States. The lack of family history tools that are easy to read or use may compromise their potential effectiveness in identifying individuals at increased risk for chronic diseases in the general population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection is a devastating postoperative complication, and the occurrence ranges from 1\% to 2\% after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The efficacy of the preoperative use of chlorhexidine for reducing infection has been debated. This meta-analysis aimed to examine the efficacy of the use of chlorhexidine to prevent surgical site infections after TKA. METHODS: In February 2017, a systematic literature review was conducted using the following electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Google database. Data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and retrospective comparative study (RCS) that compared the use of chlorhexidine versus control washes to prep patients for TKA were retrieved. The primary endpoint was to compare the total incidence of infection with and without the use of chlorhexidine. The secondary outcomes were the incidence of infection in low-risk category patients, moderate-risk category patients, and high-risk category patients. After testing for publication bias and heterogeneity between studies, data were aggregated for random-effects modeling when necessary. RESULTS: Four clinical trials that included 8787 patients (chlorhexidine group: n = 2615, control group: n = 6172) were ultimately included in the meta-analysis. Chlorhexidine was associated with a reduced total incidence of infection, corresponding to a reduction of 1.69\% [risk ratio (RR) = 0.22; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) = 0.12-0.40; P = .000]. Similarly, chlorhexidine was associated with a reduction in the incidence of infection among patients in the moderate-risk category (RR, 0.18; 95\% CI, 0.05-0.63; P = .007) and the high-risk category (RR, 0.13; 95\% CI, 0.03-0.67; P = .014). There was no significant difference between the incidence of infection in low-risk category patients with chlorhexidine use compared with the use of control washes (RR, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.22-1.60; P = .330). CONCLUSION: The preoperative use of chlorhexidine could reduce the total incidence of infection and the incidence of infection in moderate-risk and high-risk category patients. The overall evidence and the number of included studies was limited; thus, a greater number of high-quality RCTs is still needed to further identify the effects of chlorhexidine on reducing the incidence of infection after TKA.},

Here, we described the  genomic characteristics of an IMP-38-producing ST307 K. pneumoniae strain and  investigated the prevalence of bla(IMP-38) among carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella  pneumoniae isolates from a tertiary care hospital in central China. A total of 14  IMP-38-producing ST307 K. pneumoniae strains were identified from 2013 to 2016,  with 13 strains isolated from patients with neonatal sepsis in the neonatal ward.  PacBio and Illumina whole-genome sequencing analysis performed on a  representative IMP-38-producing K. pneumoniae strain, WCGKP294, showed that it  contained a circular chromosome and two plasmids. Carbapenemase gene bla(IMP-38)  is colocated with bla(CTX-M-3) in transposon Tn6382 on an IncHI5 plasmid  (pWCGKP294-2). WCGKP294 harbors another IncFIB plasmid, pWCGKP294-1, carrying  three copies of tandem-repeated IS26-bla(SHV-2A)-deoR-ygbJ-ygbK-fucA-IS26  composite transposon elements. Phylogenetic analysis placed WCGKP294 in the  global ST307 cluster, distant from the U.S. (Texas) and South Africa clusters.  Nevertheless, WCGKP294 does not contain the chromosomal fluoroquinolone  resistance-associated mutations and IncFIIK/IncFIBK plasmid-associated  bla(CTX-M-15) gene that are frequently found in other global ST307  strains.IMPORTANCE We described the genome and resistome characterization of a  carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae ST307 strain carrying bla(IMP-38) in  China. This report highlights that the high-risk ST307 clone continues to acquire  different antimicrobial resistance genes, posing significant challenges to  clinical practice, and should be closely monitored.},

As such, it is a significant outcome variable of health promotion efforts. Valid and reliable instruments are needed to evaluate health promotion interventions and to assess levels of HL in a population. One of the few measurements of communicative and critical HL is the Japanese Communicative and Critical Health Literacy scale (C \& C HL scale). To make it possible to use this instrument in Sweden, the C \& C HL scale was translated into Swedish and different aspects of validity, including test-retest reliability, of the translated version were tested. METHODS: After translation and back-translation, The Swedish C \& C HL scale was tested for content validity and test-retest reliability. Data were collected from a committee consisting of public health experts and bilingual people, and from a test group of 35 persons. RESULTS: The Swedish C \& C HL scale was understandable and showed evidence of content validity. The test-retest confirmed that it was stable over time, percentage agreements for the items ranging from 66\% to 89\% (M = 74\%). CONCLUSIONS: The Swedish C \& C HL scale is equivalent to the Japanese C \& C HL scale in terms of language and content. The items cover the major aspects of communicative and critical HL and are understandable and stable over time, i.e., reliable.},

This study aims to determine levels of functional and comprehensive health literacy, and factors associated with inadequate health literacy, in refugees coming to Sweden. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was performed among 455 adult refugees speaking Arabic, Dari, Somali or English. Participants in 16 strategically selected language schools for immigrants responded to a questionnaire. Health literacy was measured using the Swedish Functional Health Literacy Scale and the HLS-EU-Q16 questionnaire. Uni- and multivariate statistical methods were used to investigate group differences. RESULTS: The majority of the participating refugees had inadequate or limited functional health literacy and comprehensive health literacy. About 60\% of them had inadequate functional health literacy and 27\% had inadequate comprehensive health literacy. Low education and/or being born in Somalia were factors associated with an increased risk of having inadequate functional health literacy. Having inadequate functional health literacy was associated with an increased risk of having inadequate comprehensive health literacy. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of refugees in the language schools had limited or poor health literacy. Health literacy should be taken into consideration in contexts and in activities addressing migrants. More research is needed to better understand health literacy among refugees and to develop strategies and methods to increase health literacy and make life easier for those with low health literacy.},

One possible reason for an absence of effects is the level of functional health literacy among the individuals that participate in the interventions. Thus, valid and reliable instruments that capture these kinds of skills are needed. The aim of this study was to develop a Swedish Functional Health Literacy scale to use in health promotion and health prevention by translating the Japanese Functional Health Literacy scale into Swedish and testing some aspects of its validity and test-retest reliability. METHODS: The research project comprised six phases including translation and back translation, validity tests of the two first versions of the instrument based on interviews with professionals and representatives for the target group of the instrument, and a test-retest of the first version among target groups. RESULTS: The items in the first two versions were experienced as unclear, which led to improvements of the next version. The final version of the translated instrument (the Swedish Functional Literacy scale) showed evidence of content validity, and the test-retest confirmed that the instrument had stability over time with a percentage agreement for the items ranging from 63\% to 92\% (M = 77.2\%). CONCLUSION: The items in the Swedish version of the scale are equivalent to the original Japanese scale in terms of language and contents and cover the major aspects of functional health literacy as it is defined in the literature. The translated instrument shows stability over time, that is, reliability, at least for a part of the Swedish population. More validity tests of the Swedish Functional Health Literacy scale based on a broader population are needed.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of the health examination for asylum seekers in most countries is to identify poor health in order to secure the well-being of seekers of asylum and to guarantee the safety of the population in the host country. Functional health literacy is an individual's ability to read information and instructions about health and to function effectively as a patient in the health system, and comprehensive health literacy is an individual's competence in accessing, understanding, appraising and applying health information. Little is known about refugees' health literacy and their experiences of the health examination for asylum seekers. The purposes of the study were to investigate refugees' experiences of communication during their health examination for asylum seekers and the usefulness of that examination, and whether health literacy is associated with those experiences. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was made among 360 adult refugees speaking Arabic, Dari, Somali or English. Health literacy was measured using the Swedish Functional Health Literacy Scale and the short European Health Literacy Questionnaire. Experiences of communication and the usefulness of the health examination were measured in several questions. Associations were sought using univariate and multivariate statistical models. RESULTS: In the health examination for asylum seekers, a poor quality of communication was experienced by 36 \%, receiving little information about health care by 55 \%, and receiving little new knowledge by 41 \% and/or help by 26 \%. Having inadequate as compared to sufficient comprehensive health literacy was associated with the experience of a poorer quality of communication (OR: 9.64, CI 95 \%: 3.25-28.58) and the experience of receiving little valuable health care information (OR: 6.54, CI 95 \%: 2.45-17.47). Furthermore, having inadequate as compared to sufficient comprehensive health literacy was associated with the experience of not receiving new knowledge (OR: 7.94, CI 95 \%: 3.00-21.06) or receiving help with health problems (OR: 8.07, 95 \% CI: 2.50-26.07. Functional healthy literacy was not associated with experiences of HEA. CONCLUSION: Refugees' experiences indicate that a low level of comprehensive health literacy can act as a barrier to fulfilling the purposes of the health examination for asylum seekers. Comprehensive health literacy seems to be of greater importance in that context than functional health literacy.},

Six hundred hypertensive older adults had their blood pressure level recorded and were interviewed using questionnaires. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to determine the effect size, both direct and indirect, among factors. Almost half (48.7\%) of studied subjects had inadequate health literacy, 98.3\% had good medication adherence, and 80\% had good blood pressure levels. The highest effect size on health literacy was literacy, followed by cognitive ability, and culture and society. Medication adherence was affected directly and indirectly by cognitive ability, literacy, and culture and society. Health literacy had not only a direct effect on medication adherence but was also the mediator. Finally, the highest effect size on blood pressure level was critical and communicative health literacy. These findings suggest that health literacy should be considered in the Health Literacy Program of the National Public Health Policy and Plan, Ministry of Public Health.},

However, little is known about the composition of polypharmacy: which are the most frequently used drugs, and how much do these drugs contribute to the overall prevalence of polypharmacy. METHODS: A total of 822,619 Swedes aged {$>$}/=75 years was identified from the Total Population Register. Through record-linkage with the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register and the Social Services Register we could analyze concurrent drug use in the entire population (both individuals living in the community and institution) on the 31 December 2013. RESULTS: The prevalence of polypharmacy ({$>$}/=5 drugs) was 45\%. The most frequently used drugs were cardiovascular drugs, analgesics, and psychotropics. By excluding the ten most frequently used drug classes or compounds, the prevalence of polypharmacy was reduced by 69\% and 51\% respectively. The majority of the users of either one of the 10 most frequently used drugs concurrently used at least 4 other drug classes (66\%-85\%). CONCLUSION: Almost half of the individuals aged {$>$}/=75 years are exposed to polypharmacy in Sweden. A handful of drugs make a large contribution to the overall prevalence of polypharmacy and the majority of drugs prescribed to persons aged {$>$}/=75 years are used in combination with other drugs. This highlights the high use of drugs, and the need to consider other concurrent drug treatments when prescribing for older adults.},

In the United States, there is overlap in the population affected by sickle cell disease and those with the greatest burden of social needs. Hematology providers caring for patients with SCD have an opportunity to screen for and mitigate social determinants of health, especially in those receiving chronic transfusion therapy given the frequent interactions with the healthcare system and increased demand on already potentially limited resources. Given the complexity of the treatment and medication regimens, providers caring for patients receiving chronic transfusions should implement universal strategies to minimize the impact of low health literacy, as this therapy imposes a significant demand on the health literacy skills of a family. Despite the social and literacy burden of this intervention, it is reassuring that quality of life is preserved as patients with SCD on chronic transfusion therapy often report higher health related quality of life than their peers receiving other disease modifying therapies.},

Preoperative bathing or showering with an antiseptic skin wash product is a well-accepted procedure for reducing skin bacteria (microflora). It is less clear whether reducing skin microflora leads to a lower incidence of surgical site infection. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence for preoperative bathing or showering with antiseptics for the prevention of hospital-acquired (nosocomial) surgical site infection. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (December 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2005) and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing any antiseptic preparation used for preoperative full-body bathing or showering with non-antiseptic preparations in patients undergoing surgery. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed studies for selection, trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials involving a total of 10,007 participants were included. Three of the included trials had three comparison groups. The antiseptic used in all trials was 4\% chlorhexidine gluconate (Hibiscrub). Three trials involving 7691 participants compared chlorhexidine with a placebo. Bathing with chlorhexidine compared with a placebo did not result in a statistically significant reduction in SSIs; the relative risk of SSI (RR) was 0.91 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.04). When only trials of high quality were included in this comparison, the RR of SSI was 0.95 (95\%CI 0.82 to 1.10). Three trials of 1443 participants compared bar soap with chlorhexidine; when combined there was no difference in the risk of SSIs (RR 1.02, 95\% CI 0.57 to 1.84). Two trials of 1092 patients compared bathing with chlorhexidine with no washing, one large study found a statistically significant difference in favour of bathing with chlorhexidine (RR 0.36, 95\%CI 0.17 to 0.79). The second smaller study found no difference between patients who washed with chlorhexidine and those who did not wash preoperatively. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review provides no clear evidence of benefit for preoperative showering or bathing with chlorhexidine over other wash products, to reduce surgical site infection. Efforts to reduce the incidence of nosocomial surgical site infection should focus on interventions where effect has been demonstrated.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In Singapore, subsidized primary care is provided by centralized polyclinics; since 2000, policies have allowed lower-income Singaporeans to utilize subsidies at private general-practitioner (GP) clinics. We sought to determine whether proximity to primary care, subsidised primary care, or having regular primary care associated with health screening participation in a low socioeconomic-status public rental-flat community in Singapore. METHODS From 2009-2014, residents in five public rental-flat enclaves (N\,=\,936) and neighboring owner-occupied precincts (N\,=\,1060) were assessed for participation in cardiovascular and cancer screening. We then evaluated whether proximity to primary care, subsidised primary care, or having regular primary care associated with improved adherence to health screening. We also investigated attitudes to health screening using qualitative methodology. RESULTS In the rental flat population, for cardiovascular screening, regular primary care was independently associated with regular diabetes screening (adjusted odds ratio, aOR\,=\,1.59, CI\,=\,1.12-2.26, p\,=\,0.009) and hyperlipidemia screening (aOR\,=\,1.82, CI\,=\,1.10-3.04, p\,=\,0.023). In the owner-occupied flats, regular primary care was independently associated with regular hypertension screening (aOR\,=\,9.34 (1.82-47.85, p\,=\,0.007), while subsidized primary care was associated with regular diabetes screening (aOR\,=\,2.94, CI\,=\,1.04-8.31, p\,=\,0.042). For cancer screening, in the rental flat population, proximity to primary care was associated with less participation in regular colorectal cancer screening (aOR\,=\,0.42, CI\,=\,0.17-0.99, p\,=\,0.049) and breast cancer screening (aOR\,=\,0.29, CI\,=\,0.10-0.84, p\,=\,0.023). In the owner-occupied flat population, for gynecological cancer screening, usage of subsidized primary care and proximity to primary care was associated with higher rates of breast cancer and cervical cancer screening; however, being on regular primary care followup was associated with lower rates of mammography (aOR\,=\,0.10, CI\,=\,0.01-0.75, p\,=\,0.025). On qualitative analysis, patients were discouraged from screening by distrust in the doctor-patient relationship; for cancer screening in particular, patients were discouraged by potential embarrassment. CONCLUSIONS Regular primary care was independently associated with regular participation in cardiovascular screening in both low-SES and higher-SES communities. However, for cancer screening, in the low-SES community, proximity to primary care was associated with less participation in regular screening, while in the higher-SES community, regular primary care was associated with lower screening participation; possibly due to embarrassment regarding screening modalities.}

We also explored whether the relationship between socio-demographics and happiness is mediated by perceived health. The dependent variable, happiness, was dichotomized as happy versus unhappy. Independent variables or correlates of happiness included race (Black or White), age ({$<$} 65 vs. 65 and older), gender (male vs. female), perceived income (sufficient vs. insufficient to meet basic needs), health literacy (adequate vs. inadequate), and self-rated health (excellent/very good/good vs. poor/fair). Data were analyzed using generalized linear latent and mixed models to examine the relationship between happiness and its correlates. Our findings suggest that adequate health literacy and better perceived health are associated with an increase in the likelihood of happiness. In addition, the relationship between perceived sufficient income and happiness is mediated by perceived health; whereas, individuals with sufficient income are more likely to have better perceived health, and as a result more likely to be happy. Other individual factors, such as gender, age, and race were not significantly associated with being happy or having higher perceived health in any of the models. Results suggest that policies aimed at increasing health literacy, promoting health, and reducing income disparities may be associated with greater happiness.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the impact of health literacy (HL) on trauma patient outcomes remains unclear, recent studies have demonstrated that trauma patients with deficient HL have poor understanding of their injuries, are less likely to comply with follow-up, and are relatively less satisfied with physician communication. In this study, we sought to determine if HL deficiency was associated with comprehension of discharge instructions. METHODS: In this prospective study, hospitalized trauma patients underwent evaluation of HL prior to discharge. Newest Vital Sign (NVS) instrument was used to score HL as deficient, marginal, or proficient. Three days postdischarge, patients were telephonically administered a six-point scored questionnaire regarding comprehension of discharge instructions. A general linear model was used to determine the association between HL and comprehension of discharge instructions. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were administered both NVS and discharge instruction questionnaire. Ten (15.9\%) patients scored as deficient in HL on the NVS screen, 16 (25.4\%) as marginally proficient, and 37 (58.7\%) as proficient. The HL proficiency significantly predicted follow-up score with increasing proficiency associated with higher scores on the discharge comprehension assessment (p {$<$} 0.001). Adjusted mean scores ({\textpm} SE) for deficient, marginal, and proficient patients were 2.8 {\textpm} 0.5, 3.2 {\textpm} 0.4, and 4.7 {\textpm} 0.2. Post hoc comparisons demonstrated significant differences between proficient with marginal proficiency (p = 0.002) and deficient proficiency (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Performance on bedside test of HL among trauma inpatients predicted ability to comprehend instructions following hospital discharge. This study supports the value of HL screening prior to discharge. The HL-deficient patients may benefit from a transitional care program to improve comprehension of discharge instructions after leaving the hospital.

Outcomes were baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-month postintervention HbA1c levels (primary) and frequency of diabetes self-care, 3-day pedometer readings, 24-hour diet recalls, average number of glucose checks, physical fitness, depression, coping style, self-efficacy, and quality of life (secondary).Linear mixed modeling found that all groups showed improved HbA1c levels (P~{$<~$}.001). However, the structured behavioral arm showed greater improvements than the group and individual control arms (3-month HbA1c concentration changes: -0.8\% vs -0.4\% and -0.4\%, respectively (P~=~.04 for group~~time interaction). Furthermore, participants with type 2 disease showed greater improvement than those with type 1 (P~=~.04 for type of diabetes~~time interaction). Quality of life, glucose monitoring, and frequency of diabetes self-care did not differ by intervention over time.A structured, cognitive behavioral program is more effective than 2 control interventions in improving glycemia in adults with long-duration diabetes. Educators can successfully use modified psychological and behavioral strategies.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT000142922},

  abstract = {There are two hallmarks of aging that must be considered primary concerns when trying to improve health for older adults: frailty and chronic diseases. Some pathologic mechanisms related to diseases may help to explain frailty. This article describes known associations among frailty and chronic diseases and introduces punished inefficiency as an explanatory framework for frailty. Punished inefficiency proposes that having several physiologic impairments leads to physiologic inefficiencies. These inefficiencies may become manifest as frailty, often in the presence of disease. Therefore, frail older adults perform less external work because they must spend more on an absolute scale out of a smaller pool of internal resources. Stress imposed on frail older adults strengthens this negative feedback to activity, leading to disuse. This article discusses how people with frailty and chronic diseases may experience a malignant course and thereby intends to improve the ability to identify beneficial biologic and health care delivery strategies for older adults with, or at risk of, frailty.},

This study sought to determine whether a nonlinear relationship between BP and mortality-as described for the broader CKD population and for older adults in the general population-is present for older adults with CKD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, \& MEASUREMENTS: A cohort of 21,015 adults age 65-105 years with a moderate or severe reduction in eGFR ({$<$}60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) were identified within the Kaiser Permanente Northwest Health Maintenance Organization population. The relationship between baseline systolic BP (SBP; {$\leq$}120, 121-130, 131-140, 141-150, {$>$}150 mmHg; referent, 131-140 mmHg) and all-cause mortality across age groups (65-70, 71-80, and {$>$}80 years) was examined; patients were followed for up to 11 years after cohort entry. RESULTS: The median times at risk were 3.15 years, 3.53 years, and 2.76 years for adults age 65-70, 71-80, and {$>$}80 years, respectively. Mortality during follow-up was 19.6\% for those age 65-70 years, 33.4\% for those age 71-80 years, and 55.7\% for those age {$>$}80 years. The relationship between SBP and mortality varied as a function of age. The risk of death was highest for patients with the lowest SBP in all age groups. Only among adults age 65-70 years was an SBP{$>$}140 mmHg associated with a higher risk of death compared with the referent category. Patterns of age modification of the relationship between SBP and mortality were consistent in all sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of older adults, the relationship between SBP and mortality varied systematically with age. A relationship between higher SBP and mortality was present only for younger members of this cohort and not for those older than 70. These results raise the question of whether the relative benefits and harms of lowering BP to recommended targets for older adults with CKD may vary as a function of age.},

The objective of this study was to determine whether the medication review tool in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Health Literacy Universal Precautions Toolkit can help to improve medication reviews in primary care practices. METHODS: The toolkit's "Brown Bag Medication Review" was implemented in a rural private practice in Missouri and an urban teaching practice in California. Practices recorded outcomes of medication reviews with 45 patients before toolkit implementation and then changed their medication review processes based on guidance in the toolkit. Six months later we conducted interviews with practice staff to identify changes made as a result of implementing the tool, and practices recorded outcomes of medication reviews with 41 additional patients. Data analyses compared differences in whether all medications were brought to visits, the number of medications reviewed, drug therapy problems identified, and changes in medication regimens before and after implementation. RESULTS: Interviews revealed that practices made the changes recommended in the toolkit to encourage patients to bring medications to office visits. Evaluation before and after implementation revealed a 3-fold increase in the percentage of patients who brought all their prescription medications and a 6-fold increase in the number of prescription medications brought to office visits. The percentage of reviews in which drug therapy problems were identified doubled, as did the percentage of medication regimens revised. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the Health Literacy Universal Precautions Toolkit can help to identify drug therapy problems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal septicemia is a life threatening medical emergency that requires timely detection of pathogens with urgent rational antibiotics therapy.  METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between March 2017 to September  2018 among 317 septicemia suspected neonates at neonatal intensive care unit,  Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Mekelle, Tigray, North Ethiopia. A 3 mL  of blood was collected from each participant. Identification of bacterial species  was done using the standard microbiological techniques. Antibiotic sensitivity  test was done using disk diffusion method. Data were entered and analyzed using  computer software SPSS version 22. Bivariate and multivariate regression analysis  was applied to determine the association between variables. RESULTS: Of the 317  (190 male and 127 female) neonates, 116 (36.6\%) were found to be with culture  proven septicemia. Klebsiella species were the predominant etiologic agents.  Length of hospital stay (AOR (adjusted odds ratio) = 3.65 (2.17-6.13), p {$<$} 0.001)  and low birth weight (AOR = 1.64 (1.13-2.78), p = 0.04) were the factors  associated with neonatalsepticemia. Most isolates showeda frightening drug  resistance rate to the commonly used antimicrobial drugs. K. pneumoniae, E. coli,  Enterobacter and Citrobacter species were 57\% to100\% resistant to ceftazidime,  ceftriaxone, gentamycin, amoxacillin-clavulunic acid and ampicillin. All, 9  (100\%) isolates of S. aureus were resistant to oxacilline,  ampicillin,erythromycin and gentamycin. Furthermore, 55.6\% S. aureus isolates  were Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: Neonaltal  septicemia is found to be significantly high in the present study. As most of the  isolates are potentially related to hospital acquired infections, prevention and  control policy should have to be more strengthening in the neonatal intensive  care unit.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a significant global health issue associated with marked regional disparities in mortality. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a  growing concern in Gram-negative organisms, which increasingly predominate in  neonatal sepsis, and existing WHO empirical antibiotic recommendations may no  longer be appropriate. Previous systematic reviews have been limited to specific  low- and middle-income countries. We therefore completed a systematic review and  meta-analysis of available data from all low- and lower-middle-income countries  (LLMICs) since 2010, with a focus on regional differences in Gram-negative  infections and AMR. METHODS AND FINDINGS: All studies published from 1 January  2010 to 21 April 2021 about microbiologically confirmed bloodstream infections or  meningitis in neonates and AMR in LLMICs were assessed for eligibility. Small  case series, studies with a small number of Gram-negative isolates ({$<$}10), and  studies with a majority of isolates prior to 2010 were excluded. Main outcomes  were pooled proportions of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter,  Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and AMR. We included 88 studies (4 cohort studies, 3  randomised controlled studies, and 81 cross-sectional studies) comprising 10,458  Gram-negative isolates from 19 LLMICs. No studies were identified outside of  Africa and Asia. The estimated pooled proportion of neonatal sepsis caused by  Gram-negative organisms was 60\% (95\% CI 55\% to 65\%). Klebsiella spp. was the most  common, with a pooled proportion of 38\% of Gram-negative sepsis (95\% CI 33\% to  43\%). Regional differences were observed, with higher proportions of  Acinetobacter spp. in Asia and Klebsiella spp. in Africa. Resistance to  aminoglycosides and third-generation cephalosporins ranged from 42\% to 69\% and  from 59\% to 84\%, respectively. Study limitations include significant  heterogeneity among included studies, exclusion of upper-middle-income countries,  and potential sampling bias, with the majority of studies from tertiary hospital  settings, which may overestimate the burden caused by Gram-negative bacteria.  CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacteria are an important cause of neonatal sepsis in  LLMICs and are associated with significant rates of resistance to WHO-recommended  first- and second-line empirical antibiotics. AMR surveillance should underpin  region-specific empirical treatment recommendations. Meanwhile, a significant  global commitment to accessible and effective antimicrobials for neonates is  required.},

A systematic search in different databases (APA PsycInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) resulted in 99 articles, reporting on 107 studies. Participants: Studies had a median sample size of 1,863 adults with a median age of 66 years. A randomized effect meta-analysis showed a significant, small effect (likelihood ratio = 1.347; 95\% confidence interval [1.300, 1.396]; p {$<$} .001), similar in magnitude to the previous meta-analysis of 19 studies. Although the results showed high heterogeneity in the longitudinal link between SA and health outcomes, there were no differences in effects according to chronological age of participants, welfare state status (more or less developed social security system), length of follow-up, type of health-related outcome, or quality of the study. Effects were stronger for multiitem measures of self-perceptions of aging than for the frequently used single-item measures assessing subjective age, especially for indicators of physical health. Based on this meta-analysis, building on five times more studies than the 2014 review, we consider the associations of measures of SA with health and longevity across time as robust, albeit small in size. Future research should concentrate on the clarification of pathways mediating the relation between SA and health outcomes, as well as potential bidirectional effects.

  abstract = {Health literacy is discussed in papers from 25 countries where findings suggest that approximately a third up to one half of the people in developed countries have low health literacy. Specifically, health literacy is the mechanism by which individuals obtain and use health information to make health decisions about individual treatments in the home, access care in the community, promote provider-patient interactions, structure self-care, and navigate health care programs both locally and nationally. Further, health literacy is a key determinant of health and a critical dimension for assessing individuals' needs, and, importantly, their capacity for self-care. Poorer health knowledge/status, more medication errors, costs, and higher rates of morbidity, readmissions, emergency room visits, and mortality among patients with health illiteracy have been demonstrated. Individuals at high risk for low health literacy include the elderly, disabled, Blacks, those with a poverty-level income, some or less high school education, either no insurance or Medicare or Medicaid, and those for whom English is a second language. As a consequence, health literacy is a complex, multifaceted, and evolving construct including aspects of social, psychological, cultural and economic circumstances. The purpose of this paper is to describe the mechanisms and consequences of health illiteracy. Specifically, the prevalence, associated demographics, and models of health literacy are described. The mechanism of health illiteracy's influence on outcomes in heart failure is proposed. Tools for health literacy assessment are described and compared. Finally, the health outcomes and general interventions to enhance the health outcomes in heart failure are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: The burden of morbidity represented by patients with long term conditions (LTCs) varies substantially between general practices. This study aimed to determine the characteristics of general practices with high morbidity burden. Method: Retrospective cross-sectional study; general practices in England, 2014/15. Three composite morbidity measures (MMs) were constructed to quantify LTC morbidity at practice level: a count of LTCs derived from the 20 LTCs included in the UK Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) disease registers, expressed as `number of QOF LTCs per 100 registered patients'; the \% of patients with one or more QOF LTCs; the \% of patients with one or more of 15 broadly defined LTCs included in the GP Patient Survey (GPPS). Determinants of MM scores were analysed using multi-level regression models. Analysis was based on a national dataset of English general practices (n\,=\,7779 practices); GPPS responses (n\,=\,903,357); general practice characteristics (e.g. list size, list size per full time GP); patient demographic characteristics (age, deprivation status); secondary care utilisation (out-patient, emergency department, emergency admission rates). Results: Mean MM scores (95\% CIs) were: 57.7 ({\textpm}22.3) QOF LTCs per 100 registered patients; 22.8\% ({\textpm}8.2) patients with a QOF LTC; 63.5\% ({\textpm}11.7) patients with a GPPS LTC. The proportion of elderly patients and social deprivation scores were the strongest predictors of each MM score; scores were largely independent of practice characteristics. MM scores were positive predictors of secondary care utilization and negative predictors' access, continuity of care and overall satisfaction. Conclusions: Wide variation in LTC morbidity burden was observed across English general practice. Variation was determined by demographic factors rather than practice characteristics. Higher rates of secondary care utilisation in practices with higher morbidity burden have implications for resource allocation and commissioning budgets; lower reported satisfaction in these practices suggests that practices may struggle with increased workload. There is a need for a readily available metric to define the burden of morbidity and multimorbidity in general practice.},

For example, a table might show odds ratios for one or more exposures and also for several confounders from a single logistic regression. This can lead to mistaken interpretations of these estimates. We use causal diagrams to display the sources of the problems. Presentation of exposure and confounder effect estimates from a single model may lead to several interpretative difficulties, inviting confusion of direct-effect estimates with total-effect estimates for covariates in the model. These effect estimates may also be confounded even though the effect estimate for the main exposure is not confounded. Interpretation of these effect estimates is further complicated by heterogeneity (variation, modification) of the exposure effect measure across covariate levels. We offer suggestions to limit potential misunderstandings when multiple effect estimates are presented, including precise distinction between total and direct effect measures from a single model, and use of multiple models tailored to yield total-effect estimates for covariates.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe the content and potentials of the new Swedish national register on prescribed and dispensed medicines. METHODS: The Swedish Prescribed Drug Register contains information about age, sex and unique identifier of the patient as well as the prescriber's profession and practice. Information regarding drug utilization and expenditures for prescribed drugs in the entire Swedish population was extracted from the first six months July-December 2005 and compared with total drug sales in the country including OTC and hospital use. RESULTS: The total quantity of drugs sold in Sweden was 2666 million DDDs, corresponding to 1608 DDD/1000 inhabitants daily. The total expenditures were 1.6 billion Euro. The prescribed drugs, included in the register, accounted for 84\% of the total utilization and 77\% of the total expenditures. About half of all men and two-thirds of all women in the country purchased drugs. The proportion increased by age. The most common drugs for chronic treatment were diuretics among women (8.8\% of the population) and antithrombotic agents among men (7.6\%). Psychotropic drugs, corticosteroids and analgesics were more common among women, while men used antithrombotic agents, antidiabetic drugs, lipid lowering agents and ACE inhibitors to a greater extent. CONCLUSIONS: The new register provides valuable data on exposure to drugs and is useful to study patterns of drug utilization. The possibilities for record linkage to other health registers gives from an international perspective good opportunities to explore drug and disease associations and the risks, benefits, effectiveness and health economical effects of drug use.},

AIMS: To examine whether the duration of depressive symptoms is associated with mortality risk. METHOD: Data (n= 9560) came from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). We assessed depressive symptom duration as the sum of examinations with an eight-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score of ⩾3; we ascertained mortality from linking our data to a national register. RESULTS: Relative to those participants who never reported symptoms, the age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratios for elevated depressive symptoms over 1, 2, 3 and 4 examinations were 1.41 (95\% CI 1.15-1.74), 1.80 (95\% CI 1.44-2.26), 1.97 (95\% CI 1.57-2.47) and 2.48 (95\% CI 1.90-3.23), respectively (Pfor trend {$<$}0.001). This graded association can be explained largely by differences in physical activity, cognitive function, functional impairments and physical illness. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of older adults, the duration of depressive symptoms was associated with mortality in a dose-response manner.},

  abstract = {Patient-provider communication is modifiable and is linked to diabetes outcomes. The association of communication quality with medical mistrust is unknown. We examined these factors within the context of a low-literacy/numeracy-focused intervention to improve diabetes care, using baseline data from diverse patients enrolled in a randomized trial of a health communication intervention. Demographics, measures of health communication (Communication Assessment Tool [CAT], Interpersonal Processes of Care survey [IPC-18]), health literacy (Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults), depression, medical mistrust, and glycemic control were ascertained. Adjusted proportional odds models were used to test the association of mistrust with patient-reported communication quality. The interaction effect of health literacy on mistrust and communication quality was also assessed. A total of 410 patients were analyzed. High levels of mistrust were observed. In multivariable modeling, patients with higher mistrust had lower adjusted odds of reporting a higher CAT score (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.67, 95\% confidence interval [CI] [0.52, 0.86], p~=~.003) and higher scores on the Communication (AOR = 0.69, 95\% CI [0.55, 0.88], p~=~.008), Decided Together (AOR = 0.74, 95\% CI [0.59, 0.93], p~=~.02), and Interpersonal Style (AOR = 0.69, 95\% CI [0.53, 0.90], p~=~.015) subscales of the IPC-18. We observed evidence of an interaction effect of health literacy for the association between mistrust and the Decided Together subscale of the IPC-18 such that patients with higher mistrust and lower literacy perceived worse communication relative to mistrustful patients with higher literacy. In conclusion, medical mistrust was associated with poorer communication with providers in this public health setting. Patients' health literacy level may vary the effect of mistrust on interactional aspects of communication. Providers should consider the impact of mistrust on communication with vulnerable diabetes populations and focus efforts on mitigating its influence.},

  abstract = {Background Populations worldwide are aging. Cognitive decline is an important precursor of dementia, illness and death and, even within the normal range, is associated with poorer performance on everyday tasks. However, the impact of age on cognitive function does not always receive the attention it deserves. Methods We have explored cross-sectional associations of age with five cognitive tests (word recall, verbal fluency, subtraction, number sequence, and numerical problem solving) in a large representative sample of over 40,000 men and women aged 16 to 100 living in the UK. Results Women performed better on word recall tests and men had higher scores for subtraction, number sequence and numerical problem solving. However, age-cognition associations were generally similar in both genders. Mean word recall and number sequence scores decreased from early adulthood with steeper declines from the mid-60s onwards Verbal fluency, subtraction and numerical problem solving scores remained stable or increased from early to mid-adulthood, followed by approximately linear declines from around age 60. Performance on all tests was progressively lower in respondents with increasingly worse self-rated health and memory. Age-related declines in word recall, verbal fluency and number sequence started earlier in those with the worst self-rated health. There was no compelling evidence for age dedifferentiation (that the general factor of cognitive ability changes in strength with age). Conclusions We have confirmed previously observed patterns of cognitive aging using a large representative population sample.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION The clinical presentation of genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection (chlamydia) in women is often indistinguishable from a urinary tract infection. While merited in the setting of dysuria, emergency department (ED) clinicians do not routinely test for chlamydia in women. The primary aim of our study was to evaluate the frequency of chlamydia testing among women presenting to the ED with dysuria. METHODS We conducted a retrospective chart review of women 19-25 years of age presenting with dysuria to an urban ED and who had been coded with urinary tract infection (UTI) as their primary diagnosis (ICD-9 599.0) from October 2005 to March 2011. We excluded women who were pregnant, had underlying anatomical or neurological urinary system pathology, had continuation of symptoms from UTI or a sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosed elsewhere, or were already on antibiotics for a UTI or STI. We identified the rates of sexual history screening, pelvic examination and chlamydia assay testing and evaluated predictors using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS Of 280 women with dysuria and a UTI diagnosis, 17\% were asked about their sexual history, with 94\% reporting recent sexual activity. Pelvic examination was performed in 23\%. We were unable to determine the overall chlamydia prevalence as only 20\% of women in the cohort were tested. Among the 20\% of women tested for chlamydia infection, 21\% tested positive. Only 42\% of chlamydia-positive women were prescribed treatment effective for chlamydia (azithromycin or doxycycline) at their visit; the remaining were prescribed UTI treatment not effective against chlamydia. Predictors of sexual history screening included vaginal bleeding (OR 5.4, 95\% CI=1.5 to 19.6) and discharge (OR 2.8, 95\% CI=1.1 to 6.9). Predictors of a pelvic examination being performed included having a complaint of vaginal discharge (OR 11.8, 95\% CI=4.2 to 32.9), a sexual history performed (OR 2.5, 95\% CI=1.1 to 5.8), abdominal pain (OR 2.2, 95\% CI=1.1 to 4.4), or pelvic pain (OR 15.3, 95\% CI=2.5 to 92.2); a complaint of urinary frequency was associated with a pelvic examination not being performed (OR 0.34, 95\% CI=0.13 to 0.86). CONCLUSION Sexual histories, pelvic examinations, and chlamydia testing were not performed in the majority of women presenting with dysuria and diagnosed with UTI in the ED. The performance of a sexual history along with the availability of self-administered vaginal swab and first-void urine-based chlamydia tests may increase identification of chlamydia infection in women with dysuria.}

METHODS AND RESULTS: Cross-sectional population samples of 50-year-old men were examined every 10th year from 1963 to 2003. Attack rates of AMI were recorded from 1975 to 2004. Prevalence of smoking decreased from 56\% in 1963 to 22\% in 2003. Leisure time physical activity decreased (n.s.), while psychological stress remained the same. Diabetes prevalence increased from 3.6\% to 6.6\%. Body mass index (BMI) increased from 24.8 to 26.4 kg m(-2). Blood pressures decreased from 138.2/90.6 to 134.7/84.9 mmHg (P = 0.00001). Serum total cholesterol decreased from 6.42 to 5.50 mmol L(-1) (P = 0.0001), but serum triglycerides increased from 1.26 to 1.71 mmol L(-1) (P = 0.0001). The multivariable risk according to total cholesterol, blood pressure and smoking for AMI decreased from the set value 1.0 in 1963 to 0.418. From 1975-1979 to 2000-2004 attack rates for AMI for the age groups 35-44, 45-54 and 55-64 declined to 45\%, 46\% and 45\%, respectively. The 28-day case fatality declined from 30\%, 38\% and 46\% to 12\%, 16\% and 20\%. CONCLUSION: The more than 50\% decline in attack rate of AMI during 30 years was comparable with the decline in risk factors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Information on medication use and drug-related problems is important in the preparation of clinical medication reviews. Critical information can only be provided by patients themselves, but interviewing patients is time-consuming. Alternatively, patient information could be obtained with a questionnaire. OBJECTIVE: In this study the agreement between patient information on medication use and drug-related problems in older patients obtained with a questionnaire was compared with information obtained during an interview. SETTING: General practice in The Netherlands. METHOD: A questionnaire was developed to obtain information on actual medication use and drug-related problems. Two patient groups {$>$}/=65 years were selected based on general practitioner electronic medical records in nine practices; I. polypharmacy and II. {$>$}/=1 predefined general geriatric problems. Eligible patients were asked to complete the questionnaire and were interviewed afterwards. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Agreement on information on medication use and drug-related problems collected with the questionnaire and interview was calculated. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients participated. Of all medications used, 87.6 \% (95 \% CI 84.7-90.5) was reported identically in the questionnaire and interview. Agreement for the complete medication list was found for 45.4 \% (95 \% CI 35.8-55.3) of the patients. On drug-related problem level, agreement between questionnaire and interview was 75 \%. Agreement tended to be lower in vulnerable patients characterized by {$>$}/=4 chronic diseases, {$>$}/=10 medications used and low health literacy. CONCLUSION: Information from a questionnaire showed reasonable agreement compared with interviewing. The patients reported more medications and drug-related problems in the interview than the questionnaire. Taking the limitations into account, a questionnaire seems a suitable tool for medication reviews that may replace an interview for most patients.},

This study aimed to determine whether health literacy, assessed by clinic staff, is associated with blood pressure among patients with hypertension. The design was a cross-sectional study of a large sample of primary care patient encounters in 3 academic medical center clinics in Nashville, Tennessee. Health literacy was assessed using the Brief Health Literacy Screen, with higher scores indicating higher health literacy. Blood pressure was extracted from the electronic health record. Using 23,483 encounters in 10,644 patients, the authors examined the association of health literacy with blood pressure in multivariable analyses, adjusting for age, gender, race, education, and clinic location. Independent of educational attainment, 3-point increases in health literacy scores were associated with 0.74 mmHg higher systolic blood pressure (95\% CI [0.38, 1.09]) and 0.30 mmHg higher diastolic blood pressure (95\% CI [0.08, 0.51]). No interaction between education and health literacy was observed (p = .91). In this large primary care population of patients with hypertension, higher health literacy, as screened in clinical practice, was associated with a small increase in blood pressures. Future research is needed to explore this unexpected finding.},

The total group was drawn from all specialties in the hospital, and by interviewing the patients, their carers, the ward sisters, and the patients' general practitioners the factors causing early unplanned readmission for each patient were identified. Seven possible principal reasons were found: relapse of original condition, development of a new problem, carer problems, complications of the initial illness, need for terminal care, problems with medication, and problems with services. There were also contributory reasons, and it was usual for several of these to be present in each case. The unplanned readmission rate was 6\%; the planned readmission rate was 3\%. It was thought that unplanned readmission was avoidable for 78 (59\%) patients. Patients in the study group and in the control group showed significant differences in certain characteristics--such as low income, previous hospital admission, already having nursing care, and admission by general practitioners--and this might help to identify patients who are likely to be readmitted in an emergency.},

The readmitted group had significantly more nursing and social services both before and after discharge than the non-readmitted group. The level of district nursing, home help and social work all increased significantly with age. Problems were experienced with services after discharge from hospital. These included: no arrangements, delay in starting services and inadequate services to meet the patient's needs.

Forty one per cent of the carers were the patient's spouse. Forty per cent of the carers did not live with the patient. Many of the carers had been attending to the personal and domestic needs of their dependents for a considerable time. Carers complained about the effect the task had on their own health and the high levels of frustration experienced. Carer problems were important principal and contributory reasons for readmission. Carers of readmitted patients experienced more problems, frustrations and concerns than the carers of control patients. It is suggested that communication between professionals and carers should be improved, and, in particular, that the needs of carers should be assessed before discharge of patients from hospital.},

This brief note presents a general proof that the estimator is unbiased for cluster-correlated data regardless of the setting. The result is not new, but a simple and general reference is not readily available. The use of the method will benefit from a general explanation of its wide applicability.}

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of intensive ({$<$}120 mm Hg) compared with standard ({$<$}140 mm Hg) SBP targets in persons aged 75 years or older with hypertension but without diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A multicenter, randomized clinical trial of patients aged 75 years or older who participated in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). Recruitment began on October 20, 2010, and follow-up ended on August 20, 2015. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment group, n = 1317) or an SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment group, n = 1319). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary cardiovascular disease outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome not resulting in a myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal acute decompensated heart failure, and death from cardiovascular causes. All-cause mortality was a secondary outcome. RESULTS Among 2636 participants (mean age, 79.9 years; 37.9\% women), 2510 (95.2\%) provided complete follow-up data. At a median follow-up of 3.14 years, there was a significantly lower rate of the primary composite outcome (102 events in the intensive treatment group vs 148 events in the standard treatment group; hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95\% CI, 0.51-0.85]) and all-cause mortality (73 deaths vs 107 deaths, respectively; HR, 0.67 [95\% CI, 0.49-0.91]). The overall rate of serious adverse events was not different between treatment groups (48.4\% in the intensive treatment group vs 48.3\% in the standard treatment group; HR, 0.99 [95\% CI, 0.89-1.11]). Absolute rates of hypotension were 2.4\% in the intensive treatment group vs 1.4\% in the standard treatment group (HR, 1.71 [95\% CI, 0.97-3.09]), 3.0\% vs 2.4\%, respectively, for syncope (HR, 1.23 [95\% CI, 0.76-2.00]), 4.0\% vs 2.7\% for electrolyte abnormalities (HR, 1.51 [95\% CI, 0.99-2.33]), 5.5\% vs 4.0\% for acute kidney injury (HR, 1.41 [95\% CI, 0.98-2.04]), and 4.9\% vs 5.5\% for injurious falls (HR, 0.91 [95\% CI, 0.65-1.29]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among ambulatory adults aged 75 years or older, treating to an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg compared with an SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg resulted in significantly lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Despite the growing significance of health literacy to public health, relatively little is known about how organizational capacity may be improved for planning, implementing and sustaining health literacy interventions. This study aimed to connect decision makers in a public health agency with evidence of how organizational capacity may be improved for delivering health literacy services. STUDY DESIGN: A rapid realist review of published and grey literature was conducted by a partnership between the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the InSource Research Group. METHODS: Realist review methodology attempts to understand what works for whom under what circumstances, and is characterized by its focus on strategies/interventions, contexts, mechanisms and their relationship to outcome. This review was completed in collaboration with a reference panel (comprised of a broad range of PHAC representatives) and an expert panel. Literature searching was conducted using three databases supplemented with bibliographic hand searches and articles recommended by panels. Data were extracted on key variables related to definitions, strategies/interventions associated with increased organizational capacity, contextual factors associated with success (and failure), mechanisms activated as a result of different strategies and contexts, key outcomes, and evidence cited. RESULTS: Strategies found to be associated with improved organizational capacity for delivering health literacy services may be classified into three domains: (1) government action; (2) organizational/practitioner action; and (3) partnership action. Government action includes developing policies to reinforce social norms; setting standards for education; conducting research; and measuring health literacy levels. Organizational/practitioner action relates to appropriate models of leadership (both high-level government engagement and distributed leadership). Innovative partnership action includes collaborations with media outlets, those producing electronic materials, community organizations and school-based programs. Contextual factors for success include positive leadership models, interorganizational relationships, and a culture committed to experimentation and learning. Potential mechanisms activated by strategies and contextual factors include increased visibility and recognition of health literacy efforts, enthusiasm and momentum for health literacy activities, reduced cognitive dissonance between vision and action, a sense of ownership for health literacy data, and creation of a common language and understanding. CONCLUSIONS: Government initiated interventions and policies are powerful strategies by which organizational capacity to improve health literacy may be affected. Using the foundations created by the government policy environment, organizations may improve the impact of health literacy interventions through supported distributed leadership.},

METHODS: The study used a retrospective parallel-group case-control design. Participants from 4 urban acute care hospitals were included in the revisit cohort if they were rehospitalized within 30 days as a result of an adverse event coded as accidental poisoning. The no-revisit cohort was formed by randomly sampling patients with the same disease classification codes as the revisit group but without history of a readmission within 30 days. Complexity of medication regimens at the initial admission and discharge was quantified with the medication regimen complexity index (MRCI). RESULTS: The revisit group comprised 92 individuals and the no-revisit group, 228. The revisit group had a significantly higher MRCI score at admission and discharge than the no-revisit group (all P {$<$} .005). Receiver operating characteristic curves, used to determine a potential MRCI cutoff score for risk of an ADE, revealed MRCI scores of 8 or greater to optimally predict increased risk for readmission caused by an ADE. CONCLUSIONS: Complex medication regimens at hospital admission are predictive of rehospitalizations for ADEs. This finding suggests that medication regimen complexity be considered as a target for interventions to decrease the risk for readmission.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medication-related problems and adverse drug events are leading causes of preventable hospitalizations. Few previous studies have investigated the possible association between medication regimen complexity and unplanned rehospitalization. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between discharge medication regimen complexity and unplanned rehospitalization over a 12-month period. METHOD: The prospective study comprised patients aged {$\geq$}70 years old consecutively admitted to a Geriatrics Evaluation and Management (GEM) unit between October 2010 and December 2011. Medication regimen complexity at discharge was calculated using the 65-item validated Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to compute unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95\% CIs for factors associated with rehospitalization over a 12-month follow-up period. RESULT: Of 163 eligible patients, 99 patients had one or more unplanned hospital readmissions. When adjusting for age, sex, activities of daily living, depression, comorbidity, cognitive status, and discharge destination, MRCI (HR = 1.01; 95\% CI = 0.81-1.26), number of discharge medications (HR = 1.01; 95\% CI = 0.94-1.08), and polypharmacy ({$\geq$}9 medications; HR = 1.12; 95\% CI = 0.69-1.80) were not associated with rehospitalization. In patients discharged to nonhome settings, there was an association between rehospitalization and the number of discharge medications (HR = 1.12; 95\% CI = 1.01-1.25) and polypharmacy (HR = 2.24; 95\% CI = 1.02-4.94) but not between rehospitalization and MRCI (HR = 1.32; 95\% CI = 0.98-1.78). CONCLUSION: Medication regimen complexity was not associated with unplanned hospital readmission in older people. However, in patients discharged to nonhome settings, the number of discharge medications and polypharmacy predicted rehospitalization. A patient's discharge destination is an important factor in unplanned medication-related readmissions.}

The  aim of this study was to describe the frequency with which index neonatal  surgical conditions are seen within our setting and to document the 30-day  outcome of these patients. METHODS: This was a single-centre prospective  observational study in which all neonates with paediatric surgical pathology  referred to the paediatric surgical unit with a corrected gestational age of  28~days were included. RESULTS: Necrotising enterocolitis was the most frequent  reason for referral to the paediatric surgical unit (n\,=\,68, 34.34\%).  Gastroschisis was the most frequent congenital anomaly referred (n\,=\,20, 10.10\%).  The overall morbidity was 57.58\%. Surgical complications contributed to 18.51\% of  morbidities. The development of gram negative nosocomial sepsis was the most  frequent cause of morbidity (n\,=\,98, 50.78\%). Mortality at 30~days was 21.74\%  (n\,=\,40). Sepsis contributed to mortality in 35 patients (87.5\%), 16 of which had  gram negative sepsis. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative sepsis was a major contributing  factor in the development of morbidity and mortality in our cohort. Prevention  and improvement in infection control are imperative if we are to improve outcomes  in our surgical neonates.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Family caregivers of cancer patients have a vital role in facilitating and sharing information about cancer, revealing a need to develop caregiver health literacy skills to support caregiver communication. The goal of this study was to investigate caregiver print materials and develop and assess a new caregiver communication resource titled A Communication Guide for Caregivers(TM) . METHODS: Using a model of six domains of caregiver health literacy skills, print cancer education materials were collected and evaluated for caregiver communication support. A new caregiver communication resource was also developed and assessed by caregivers and healthcare providers. Caregivers reviewed content and assessed utility, relatability, and reading quality. Healthcare providers also assessed whether the material would be understandable and usable for cancer caregivers. RESULTS: Only three of the 28 print materials evaluated were written at the recommended sixth grade reading level and only five addressed all six caregiver health literacy skills. Readability scores for A Communication Guide for Caregivers(TM) were at the sixth grade level, and caregivers reported its contents were relatable, useful, and easy to read. Healthcare providers also rated the material as easy for patient/family members of diverse backgrounds and varying levels of literacy to understand and use. CONCLUSIONS: Existing print-based caregiver education materials do not address caregivers' health literacy skill needs and are aimed at a highly literate caregiving population. A Communication Guide for Caregivers(TM) meets health literacy standards and family caregiver and provider communication needs. The findings are relevant for healthcare professionals who provide cancer education. Copyright {\copyright} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The purpose of this study was to explore variation in health literacy among the four family caregiver communication types: manager, partner, carrier, and lone caregivers. METHODS: The sample consisted of 115 cancer caregivers. Participants completed the Family Caregiver Communication Tool and the Health Literacy of Caregivers Scale-Cancer. RESULTS: A significant difference in health literacy domains was found between caregiver types for cancer-related communication with the care recipient (P = .038) and understanding of the health care system (P = .003). Of the health literacy domains, mean scores were highest on understanding the health care system for both lone and carrier caregivers. Manager and partner caregivers were highest on the social support domain. The self-care domain was lowest for the carrier, lone, and manager caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: There was a variation across health literacy domains among caregiver communication types, further validating the Family Caregiver Communication Typology. Findings showed a need for educational programs for cancer caregivers to strengthen their health literacy skills. As cancer caregivers have a prominent role in the delivery and quality of cancer care, it is pivotal for health care centers to provide caregiver communication training and support.},

METHODS: A three-step process was conducted: (a) two-round online Delphi method process with experts (n = 9) in cancer caregiving to gain consensus on curriculum learning objectives; (b) online survey of oncology providers (n = 32) to generate potential content and rate importance of domains; and (c) focus group of cancer caregivers (n = 6) to explore caregiving experiences and curriculum content topics. RESULTS: Overall, 17 learning objectives and 53 topics were identified for a cancer caregiver communication and health literacy curriculum. Feedback from cancer caregivers did not produce any new topics yet confirmed topics generated by experts and providers. The curriculum identified as essential has been organized under the following headings: finding cancer information; assessing and integrating information; working with health care providers; getting help; talking with the care recipient; recognizing the care recipient's needs; and planning for caregiver self-care. CONCLUSIONS: This theoretically grounded study systematically identified seven curriculum topic areas and content unique to caregivers and included input from key stakeholders. The next step is to develop the program for dissemination and to test its impact on caregiver and patient outcomes.},

Despite an incomplete understanding of the problem, numerous interventions have already been implemented with variable success. Many of those who proposed earlier strategies assumed the problem to originate from reading difficulties only. Given the timely need for more effective interventions, it is of increasing importance to reconsider the meaning of health literacy to advance our conceptual understanding of the problem and how best to respond. One potentially effective approach might involve recognizing the known associations between a larger set of cognitive and psychosocial abilities with functional literacy skills. Here we review the current health literacy definition and literature and draw on relevant research from the fields of education, cognitive science, and psychology. In this framework, a research agenda is proposed that considers an individual's "health-learning capacity," which refers to the broad constellation of cognitive and psychosocial skills from which patients or family members must draw to effectively promote, protect, and manage their own or a child's health. This new, related concept will lead, ideally, to more effective ways of thinking about health literacy interventions, including the design of health-education materials, instructional strategies, and the delivery of health care services to support patients and families across the life span.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF STUDY: To assess trends in family caregiving between 1999 and 2015. DESIGN AND METHODS: We construct nationally representative profiles of community-dwelling older adults receiving help with self-care or indoor mobility and their "primary" family or unpaid caregiver using the 1999 and 2004 National Long Term Care Survey, 2011 and 2015 National Health and Aging Trends Study, and linked caregiver surveys. Trends are examined. RESULTS: Older adults receiving help were incrementally younger, more racially diverse, and better educated in 2015. Primary caregivers overwhelmingly continued to be spouses and adult children. Arrangements were increasingly 4 years or longer in duration (shifting from 44.8\% in 1999 to 60.5\% by 2015). On average, primary caregivers provided about or in excess of 30 hr per week at all four time points. Spouses provided fewer hours of care, were twice as likely to work, and half as likely to report substantial emotional, physical, and financial difficulty due to caregiving in 2015 than 1999. Adult children provided comparable hours of care to a more impaired population; a similar proportion reported substantial caregiving-related difficulty at each time. Use of respite care nearly doubled from 8.5\% in 1999 to 15.7\% in 2015. Dementia caregivers were less likely to report substantial physical and financial difficulty and more likely to use respite care in 2015 than 1999. IMPLICATIONS: Family caregivers' circumstances generally improved during the 16-year period. Results diverge from prevailing concerns regarding the state of family caregiving and demonstrate the importance of longitudinally monitoring trends in late-life family caregiving.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Family is often overlooked in cancer care. We developed a patient-family agenda setting intervention to engage family in cancer care communication. METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (NCT03283553) of patients on active treatment for breast cancer and their family "care partner." Intervention dyads (n\,=\,69) completed a self-administered checklist to clarify care partner roles, establish a shared visit agenda, and facilitate MyChart patient portal access. Control dyads (n\,=\,63) received usual care. We assessed intervention acceptability and initial effects from post-visit surveys and MyChart utilization at 6~weeks. RESULTS: At baseline, most patients (89.4\%) but few care partners (1.5\%) were registered for MyChart. Most patients (79.4\%) wanted their care partner to have access to their records and 39.4\% of care partners reported accessing MyChart. In completing the checklist, patients and care partners endorsed active communication roles for the care partner and identified a similar visit agenda: most ({$>$}\,90\%) reported the checklist was easy, useful, and recommended it to others. At 6~weeks, intervention (vs control) care partners were more likely to be registered for MyChart (75.4\% vs 1.6\%; p\,{$<$}\,0.001), to have logged in (43.5\% vs 0\%; p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and viewed clinical notes (30.4\% vs 0\%; p\,{$<$}\,0.001), but were no more likely to exchange direct messages with clinicians (1.5\% vs 0\%; p\,=\,0.175). No differences in patients' MyChart use were observed, but intervention patients more often viewed clinical notes (50.7\% vs 9.5\%; p\,{$<$}\,0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A patient-family agenda setting intervention was acceptable and affected online practices of cancer patients and care partners.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal meningitis continues to be a devastating infection with high mortality and morbidity worldwide. The prevalence of neonatal meningitis varies  across countries. However, there is a paucity of studies on neonatal meningitis  in most low-resource settings. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the  magnitude, clinical presentations, and associated risk factors of meningitis  among newborns with neonatal sepsis. METHOD: An institution-based,  cross-sectional study was conducted among newborns with neonatal sepsis from May  1, 2021, to Oct 30, 2021. Neonates with neonatal sepsis admitted to the  University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (UOGCSH) during the study  period were included in the study. Single population proportion formula was used  to calculate the sample size and a systematic random sampling technique was used  to select the study participants. Two trained pediatric residents collected the  data by using a pretested, structured questionnaire. The data was entered into  Epi-info version 7.0 and exported to SPSS version 24.0 for analysis. Binary  logistic regression was used to identify the associated factors. P-value{$<$}0.05 was  considered statistically significant. RESULT: A total of 171 participants were  enrolled in this study. The mean postnatal age was 10.74{\textpm}8.0 days. The male to  female ratio was l.3:1. The prevalence of neonatal meningitis among suspected  sepsis was 19.3\%; 95\% CI [13.5\%-25.1\%]. The prevalence of meningitis was 22.8\% in  Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis and 16.8\% in Late-onset Neonatal Sepsis. Neurologic  symptoms (seizure \& altered mentation) were seen in 25\% of the patients with  meningitis. Two risk factors, Prolonged labor (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 4.98;  95\% CI: 1.99-12.48) and Prolonged Rupture of Membrane (AOR: 5:38; 95\% CI:  1.92-14.42) were significantly associated with neonatal meningitis. CONCLUSION:  The prevalence of neonatal meningitis was higher in early-onset neonatal sepsis  than in late-onset neonatal sepsis. Obstetric factors were associated with  neonatal meningitis. We recommend that routine CSF analysis should be practiced  in all neonates with neonatal sepsis regardless of their postnatal age and  clinical features. Early detection and treatment of obstetric factors may have  the potential to reduce neonatal meningitis.},

  abstract = {AIMS To examine the association of patient volume with quality of diabetes care in the primary care setting. METHODS We analyzed population-based data from Hospital Authority administrative database using a Hong Kong representative sample of 187,031 diabetic patients managed in 74 primary care general outpatient clinics between 04/2011 and 03/2012. We assessed the associations between annual clinic-based patient volume and quality of care in terms of adherence to care criteria of process (HbA1c test, renal function test, full lipid profile, urine protein analysis, diabetic retinopathy screening, and appropriate drug prescription) and clinical outcomes (HbA1c{$\leq$}7\%, BP{$\leq$}130/80mmHg, LDL-C{$\leq$}2.6mmol/L) of care criteria, with and without adjustment for patient and clinic characteristics. RESULTS Patient volume was associated with three of seven process of care criteria; however, when compared to clinics in higher volume quartiles, those in lowest-volume quartile had more odds of HbA1c test (odds ratios (OR): 0.781, 0.655 and 0.646 for quartile from 2 to 4, respectively), renal function test (OR: 0.357, 0.367 and 0.590 for quartile from 2 to 4, respectively), and full lipid profile test (OR: 0.508, 0.612 and 0.793 for quartile from 2 to 4, respectively). There was no significant association between patient volume and the standards of achieving of HbA1c, BP and LDL-C outcome targets. CONCLUSIONS Disparities in volume and quality of diabetes care were observed in public primary care setting. Lower patient volumes at clinic level were associated with greater adherence to three process criteria but a volume-outcome association was not present.},

  abstract = {Objective: We tested a model of individual health literacy information sharing with family members, personal preventive behaviours and family well-being during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Hong Kong. Methods: We analysed data of 1501 randomly selected Chinese adults from a cross-sectional survey in Hong Kong from 9 to 23 April, 2020. Individual health literacy about COVID-19 with the items extracted from the questionnaire in World Health Organization Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) Action Plan Guidance for COVID-19 preparedness and response, COVID-19 information sharing with family members, preventive behaviours against COVID-19 and family well-being were measured. Structural equation modelling analysis tested the proposed model. Findings: COVID-19 information sharing with family members partially mediated the association between individual health literacy and personal preventive behaviours. The direct effect of 0.24 was shown, and the indirect effect through COVID-19 information sharing with family members was small at 0.03 (Z = 3.66, p {$<$} 0.001). Family well-being was associated with personal preventive behaviours against COVID-19. The model was adjusted for sex, age, and socioeconomic status factors and had good fit with RMSEA = 0.04, CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.96, and SRMR = 0.02. Conclusion: COVID-19 information sharing with family members was a partial mediator between individual health literacy and personal preventive behaviours against COVID-19. Strategies for enhancing health literacy and preventive measures against COVID-19 are needed to promote family well-being in the pandemic.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare three simple bedside tools based on frailty phenotypes with a Frailty Index using the multiple deficit approach in the prediction of mortality and physical limitation after 4 years. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Hong Kong, China. PARTICIPANTS: Four thousand men and women aged 65 and older living in the community who were ambulatory enough to attend the study center. METHODS: Interviewers obtained information regarding physical, psychological, and functional health; body mass index (BMI), grip strength, blood pressure, and ankle brachial index were determined. Three clinical frailty scales based on the Fried phenotype (Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS); Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illness, and Loss (FRAIL); and Hubbard) and a frailty index (FI) were constructed from these variables, and their ability to predict incident mortality and physical function limitations was compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: All tools predicted adverse outcomes. More participants were categorized into frail and prefrail categories using the CHS than with the other two clinical scales. For all frailty measures, with increasing levels of frailty, the sensitivity fell and the specificity increased to greater than 90\%; the area under the ROC curve values were approximately 0.6. CONCLUSION: Simple frailty scores are comparable with a multidimensional deficit accumulation FI in predicting mortality and physical limitations. The newer FRAIL, proposed for use in a clinical setting, is comparable with other existing short screening tools, as well as tools based on the multiple-deficits model used for research settings. Addition of a physical performance measure to screening tools may increase predictive accuracy.},

  abstract = {Neonatal sepsis is a systemic infection that occurs at an early age. Its etiology varies from one region to the other. The contribution of sepsis to neonatal  mortality and morbidity is significant in resource-limited countries; however,  there is limited information about the etiology of sepsis in Sidama Regional  State, Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of  bacterial caused newborn sepsis, associated factors, and the antimicrobial  susceptibility profile of bacteria. A hospital-based prospective cross-sectional  study was conducted among 392 sepsis suspected newborns admitted to the neonatal  intensive care unit of Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from  March 2021 to November 2021. Blood specimens were collected and bacteria were  isolated using the standard culture method. The drug resistance profile of  bacteria was evaluated using the disk diffusion method. The socio-demographic and  clinical parameters of participants were gathered using a questionnaire. Binary  logistic regression was used to determine the determinants of sepsis. A variable  with a p\,{$<$}\,0.05 was considered a significant determinant of neonatal sepsis with  a 95\% confidence level. The prevalence of sepsis caused by bacteria among  newborns was 143 (36.5\%); 95\% CI (31.3-41.4). The predominant bacteria was  Klebsiella species (n\,=\,61; 42.65\%), followed by non-lactose fermenting  Gram-negative bacteria (n\,=\,27; 18.88\%) and Enterococcus species (n\,=\,26;  18.18\%). The overall proportions of antimicrobial resistance of Gram-negative  bacteria range from 10.2 to 99.1\%. All Klebsiella species were resistant to  ceftriaxone. Ppremature rupture of membrane [AOR\,=\,12.7 (95\% CI 6.430-25.106)],  absence of respiratory support [AOR\,=\,3.53 (95\% CI 1.840-6.759)], sex of newborns  [AOR\,=\,2.10 (1.214-3.560)] and reason for admission [AOR\,=\,3.17 (95\% CI  1.278-7.859)] were significantly associated with culture-confirmed neonatal  sepsis. This study indicated the contribution of bacteria in causing sepsis among  newborns; the majority of them were Gram-negative bacteria. Most recovered  bacteria were resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Pre-term, mode of delivery  and types of respiratory support were significantly associated with the  occurrence of sepsis caused by bacteria.},

It can be seen as a state of extreme vulnerability and loss of resistance to external stressors resulting in an increased risk of several adverse outcomes. Although linked with ageing, disability and co-morbidity, many consider frailty as a distinct clinical and pathophysiological entity. A problem with this concept is the search for a suitable operational definition that can be used in clinical practice. Although many exist in literature, there is no agreement on the best measure. The more popular of these definitions include Fried's model of frailty and the Frailty Index. In addition, the evidence for treatment of frailty is limited, and this raises the question on the usefulness of identifying frailty without any clear interventions to reverse this state. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Background Body mass index (BMI) and obesity rates have increased sharply since the 1980s. While multiple epidemiologic studies have found that higher adolescent cognitive ability is associated with lower adult BMI, residual and unobserved confounding due to family background may explain these associations. We used a sibling design to test this association accounting for confounding factors shared within households. Methods and findings We used data from four United States general youth population cohort studies: the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979 (NLSY-79), the NLSY-79 Children and Young Adult, the NLSY 1997 (NLSY-97), and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS); a total of 12,250 siblings from 5,602 households followed from adolescence up to age 62. We used random effects within-between (REWB) and residualized quantile regression (RQR) models to compare between- and within-family estimates of the association between adolescent cognitive ability and adult BMI (20 to 64 years). In REWB models, moving from the 25th to 75th percentile of adolescent cognitive ability was associated with -0.95 kg/m2 (95\% CI = -1.21, -0.69) lower BMI between families. Adjusting for family socioeconomic position reduced the association to -0.61 kg/m2 (-0.90, -0.33). However, within families, the association was just -0.06 kg/m2 (-0.35, 0.23). This pattern of results was found across multiple specifications, including analyses conducted in separate cohorts, models examining age-differences in association, and in RQR models examining the association across the distribution of BMI. Limitations include the possibility that within-family estimates are biased due to measurement error of the exposure, confounding via non-shared factors, and carryover effects. Conclusions The association between high adolescent cognitive ability and low adult BMI was substantially smaller in within-family compared with between-family analysis. The well-replicated associations between cognitive ability and subsequent BMI may largely reflect confounding by family background factors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low literacy increases the risk for many adverse health outcomes, but the relationship between literacy and adverse outcomes in heart failure (HF) has not been well studied. METHODS: We studied a cohort of ambulatory patients with symptomatic HF (NYHA Class II-IV within the past 6 months) who were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of self-care training recruited from internal medicine and cardiology clinics at four academic medical centers in the US. The primary outcome was combined all-cause hospitalization or death, with a secondary outcome of hospitalization for HF. Outcomes were assessed through blinded interviews and subsequent chart reviews, with adjudication of cause by a panel of masked assessors. Literacy was measured using the short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. We used negative binomial regression to examine whether the incidence of the primary and secondary outcomes differed according to literacy. RESULTS: Of the 595 study participants, 37 \% had low literacy. Mean age was 61, 31 \% were NYHA class III/IV at baseline, 16 \% were Latino, and 38 \% were African-American. Those with low literacy were older, had a higher NYHA class, and were more likely to be Latino (all p {$<$} 0.001). Adjusting for site only, participants with low literacy had an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 1.39 (95 \% CI: 0.99, 1.94) for all-cause hospitalization or death and 1.36 (1.11, 1.66) for HF-related hospitalization. After adjusting for demographic, clinical, and self-management factors, the IRRs were 1.31 (1.06, 1.63) for all-cause hospitalization and death and 1.46 (1.20, 1.78) for HF-related hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Low literacy increased the risk of hospitalization for ambulatory patients with heart failure. Interventions designed to mitigate literacy-related disparities in outcomes are warranted.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have linked frequent rehospitalizations for heart failure (HF) and increased mortality with older age, higher severity of HF, lack of an evidence-based medication regimen, and inadequate health literacy. However, the pathway between age and health outcomes in patients with HF remains unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test whether the association between age and health outcomes can be explained by severity of HF, evidence-based medication use, and health literacy in patients with HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a longitudinal study of 575 rural patients with HF recruited from outpatient clinics and hospitals. Demographics, clinical data, and health literacy were collected at baseline. HF readmissions and cardiac mortality were followed for 2 years; 57\% of patients were {$>$}/= 65 years of age. Older patients with HF were more likely to have low health literacy and less likely to be prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers. Using Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log-rank tests, health outcomes were significantly worse in patients who were {$>$}/= 65 years and in those with low health literacy. Separate Cox regressions revealed that age and health literacy predicted worse health outcomes (P = 0.006 and {$<$} 0.001, respectively). When health literacy was entered into the model, the hazard ratio for age changed from 1.49 to 1.29 (a 41\% reduction); age was no longer a significant predictor of health outcomes, but health literacy remained significant (P {$<$} 0.001), demonstrating mediation. CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy mediates the relationship between age and health outcomes in adults with HF. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

OBJECTIVES: To test the efficacy of a multi-component, family-focused, literacy-sensitive (FamLit) intervention on medication adherence in HF patients. METHODS: Forty-three HF patients and their care partners were enrolled and randomized to receive FamLit or attention-only intervention, including an in-person session at baseline and bi-weekly phone boosters for 3 months. We measured medication adherence from baseline to 3-month post-intervention using the Medication Event Monitoring System. RESULTS: After 3-month intervention, intervention patients had significantly better medication adherence than control patients. At 6 months (3-months post-intervention), intervention effect on adherence was sustained in the FamLit intervention group, while adherence decreased in the control group. CONCLUSION: Incorporating care partner support and providing an easy-to-understand intervention to patients-care partners may improve/sustain adherence.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Patient support groups (PSGs) should be designed according to the backgrounds of participants and the nature of their diseases. Using health literacy as an outcome indicator for PSGs is rare. METHODS: All questionnaires (Mandarin Multidimensional Health Literacy Questionnaire, MMHLQ) were collected from eight PSGs to evaluate the health literacy of participants. Background data of participants were also collected, including patient or family, age, and first-time participation or not. RESULTS: A total of 458 questionnaires were collected from eight PSGs. The diseases were: autoimmune disease (systemic lupus nephritis (SLE), malignancy (head and neck cancer (HNC), chronic disease (diabetes mellitus or DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), hemodialysis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), genetic disease (autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and degenerative disease (osteoporosis). For vasculitis (42.21 {\textpm} 16.49 years old for SLE) and genetic disease (48.95 {\textpm} 17.58 years old for ADPKD), participants were younger. More significant differences between first-time participation and MMHLQ scores were found in disease of osteoporosis, CKD, COPD, and hemodialysis. More significant differences between role of participation (patients themselves or family) and MMHLQ scores were found in SLE, ADPKD, hemodialysis, and CKD. More significant differences between age (elderly or not) and MMHLQ score were found in HNC, DM, CKD, COPD, and osteoporosis. CONCLUSION: Background data of participants varied across different diseases. Different disease natures and patient background statuses should therefore demand different designs in PSG. MMHLQ before PSGs can be used to help to improve the PSG curriculum on the health literacy of patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To explore doctors' knowledge, willingness, concerns and the countermeasures to the most stringent antimicrobial stewardship regulations of China which implemented in August 2012. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. A pretested 32-point structured questionnaire was distributed to doctors by sending a web link via the mobile phone application WeChat through snowball sampling methods and email groups of medical academic societies. SETTING: China. PARTICIPANTS: Doctors. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The questionnaire inquired about the doctors' experiences, knowledge, willingness, concerns and the countermeasures to the stewardship policies. RESULTS: Total of persons in the groups was 19 791, among them 1194 submitted the answers, within them, 807 were doctors. Doctors had a mean age of 39.0\,years. The majority (78.9\% in 2012, 89.1\% in 2016) reported that they were willing or very willing to accept the regulations. Almost all respondents (93.2\%) felt the stewardship regulations had the potential to adversely affect the prognosis of patients who would have been prescribed antimicrobials before they were implemented, and {$>$}65\% (65.7\% in 2012, 66.9\% in 2016) of doctors were often or always concerned about the prognosis of these patients. In 2012, 32\% of doctors prescribed restricted antimicrobials or suggested patient self-medication with restricted antimicrobials to address doctors' concerns, and this number decreased to 22.6\% in 2016. Although compulsory antimicrobial stewardship training was frequent, less than half of respondents (46.8\%) responded correctly to all three knowledge questions. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial stewardship regulations had some positive effect on rational antimicrobial use. Willingness and practice of doctors towards the regulations improved from 2012 to 2016. Knowledge about rational antimicrobial use was still lacking. Doctors found ways of accessing restricted antibiotics to address their concerns about the prognosis of patients, which undermined the implementation of the stewardship regulations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive and debilitating condition that affects individuals' quality of life. COPD self-management and supports provided by carers is key to the quality of life people living with COPD. Health literacy (HL) and Patient Activation (PA) are main drivers of self-management practices (SMPs). However, their contribution remains to be fully explored. This study aimed to examine the level of self-management practices, and the relationship with socio-demographic factors, HL and PA among multi-morbid COPD patients from rural Nepal. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted between July 2018 and January 2019. Patients completed a survey, including Self-management Practices questionnaire (SMPQ), five domains of the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ), and Patient Activation Measure (PAM). The relationship between HL, PAM, and SMPs was examined using univariate statistics. Multivariable analysis was conducted to identify the factors associated with SMPs. RESULTS: A total of 238 patients responded to the study. The mean score of SMPQ was 45.31(SD\,=\,9.00). The HLQ and PAM scores were positively correlated with the total score of SMPQ. Low level of SMPs were found to be positively associated with being uneducated ({$\beta$}\,=\,-\,0.43, p\,=\,.001), having a low family income ({$\beta$}\,=\,-\,5.22, p\,=\,.002), and, negatively associated with the presence of more than one co-morbidity ({$\beta$}\,=\,3.58, p\,=\,0.007) after controlling for other socio-demographic variables in the multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: The overall SMPs among this sample of Nepalese with COPD were low. Our findings highlight the need to implement a self-management intervention program involving patient activation and health literacy-focused activities for COPD, creating a support system for patients from low-income families and low education.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health literacy (HL) and patient activation (PA) are necessary foundations to engage patients in self-management intervention. Each concept plays a unique role in improving access to the effective self-management of chronic disease. In this cross-sectional study, we examined the levels and determinants of HL and PA among the multi-morbid COPD patients in Nepal. METHODS: We conducted interviews with a simple random sample of 238 multi-morbid COPD people from July 2018 to January 2019. The questionnaire included sociodemographic profiles, five domains of the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ), 13-item Patient Activation Measure (PAM) and patient's illness perception by Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ). Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the associations. RESULTS: Most people with COPD had low health levels across each of the five domains of the HLQ. The proportion of people with low literacy level across each of the domains was: (i) feeling understood and supported by healthcare providers (79.0\%), (ii) having sufficient information to manage my own health (76.5\%), (iii) social support for health (77.3\%), (iv) ability to find the good health information (75.2\%), and (v) understand the health information well enough to know what to do (74.8\%), respectively. The majority of patients also reported low levels of patient activation (level 1: 81.5\%; level 2: 11.8\%), with only 6.7\% (level 3: 5\%; level 4: 1.7\%) reported higher patient activation level. We found significant associations between poor HL levels in the HLQ domains and having no education, being female or from Indigenous and Dalits communities, and having a monthly family income of less than USD176. Having no education and poor illness perception were significantly associated with poor activation level on PAM scale. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of multi-morbid COPD peoples had low levels of HL and were less activated than what would be required to self-manage COPD. These were in turn associated with socioeconomic factors and poor illness perception. The findings from this study are being used to design a COPD self-management program tailored to the low health literate population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between depressive disorders and subsequent cognitive decline is controversial. We tested the hypothesis that elderly women (aged 65 years and older) without dementia but with depressive symptoms have worse cognitive function and greater cognitive decline than women with few or no symptoms. METHODS: As part of an ongoing prospective study, we evaluated 5781 elderly, mostly white, community-dwelling women. Women completed the Geriatric Depression Scale short form. Three cognitive tests--Trails B, Digit Symbol, and a modified Mini-Mental State Examination--were administered at baseline and approximately 4 years later. Baseline, follow-up, and change scores for the cognitive tests were analyzed by analysis of covariance and Kruskal-Wallis analysis; the odds of cognitive deterioration ({$>$} or =3-point decline on the modified Mini-Mental State Examination) were determined by logistic regression. RESULTS: At baseline, 211 (3.6\%) of the women had 6 or more depressive symptoms. Only 16 (7.6\%) of these women were receiving antidepressant medication. Increasing symptoms of depression were associated with worse performance at baseline and follow-up on all 3 tests of cognitive function (P{$<$}.001 for all comparisons). For example, the baseline Digit Symbol score (mean +/- SD) was 45.5 +/- 10.7 among women with 0 to 2 symptoms of depression, 40.3 +/- 10.7 for women with 3 to 5 symptoms, and 39.0 +/- 11.3 for women with 6 or more symptoms. After adjusting for the baseline score, cognitive change scores were also inversely associated with the number of depressive symptoms (P{$<$}.001 for all comparisons). Odds ratios for cognitive deterioration using 0 to 2 symptoms as the reference were 1.6 (95\% confidence interval, 1.3-2.1) for 3 to 5 symptoms and 2.3 (95\% confidence interval, 1.6-3.3) for 6 or more symptoms. Results were similar after being adjusted for education, age, health status, exercise, alcohol use, functional status, and clinic site. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms in older women are associated with both poor cognitive function and subsequent cognitive decline. Mechanisms underlying the association between these 2 common conditions need further exploration.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to gain an understanding of older people's perceptions of falls prevention advice, and how best to design communications that will encourage older people to take action to prevent falls. Focus groups and interviews were carried out with 66 people aged 61-94 years recruited from a variety of settings, using falls prevention messages to stimulate discussion. Thematic analysis revealed that participants interpreted 'falls prevention' principally as meaning hazard reduction, use of aids and restriction of activity. Only one participant was aware that falls risk could be reduced by carrying out exercises to improve strength and balance. Falls prevention advice was typically regarded as useful in principle but not personally relevant or appropriate. Advice about falling was often depicted as common sense, only necessary for older or more disabled individuals, and potentially patronizing and distressing. Our findings suggest that older people do not reject falls prevention advice because of ignorance of their risk of falling, but because they see it as a potential threat to their identity and autonomy. Messages that focus on the positive benefits of improving balance may be more acceptable and effective than advice on falls prevention.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop recommendations for promoting uptake of and adherence to falls-prevention interventions among older people.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nDESIGN: The recommendations were initially developed from literature review, clinical experience of the core group members, and substantial qualitative and quantitative studies of older people's views. They were refined through a consultation process with members of the falls-prevention community, drawing on Delphi survey and nominal group techniques. Transparency was enhanced by recording and reporting aspects of the iterative consultation process such as the degree of consensus and critical comments on drafts of the recommendations.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nSETTING: The recommendations were developed and refined at three meetings of the core group, and through internet-based consultation and two meetings involving members of the wider falls-prevention community.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nPARTICIPANTS: The authors developed the recommendations incorporating the feedback from the researchers and practitioners responding to a broad-based internet consultation and consulted in the meetings.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: A high degree of consensus was achieved. Recommendations addressed the need for public education, ensuring that interventions were compatible with a positive identity, tailoring interventions to the specific situation and values of the individual, and using validated methods to maintain longer-term adherence.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: These recommendations represent a consensus based on current knowledge and evidence, but the evidence base from which these recommendations were developed was limited, and not always specific to prevention of falls. To increase the effectiveness of falls-prevention interventions, further research is needed to identify the features of falls-prevention programmes that will encourage older people's engagement in them.},

Despite being one of the most frequently used qualitative research methodologies in educational research, the methodologists do not have a full consensus on the design and implementation of case study, which hampers its full evolution. Focusing on the landmark works of three prominent methodologists, namely Robert Yin, Sharan Merriam, Robert Stake, I attempt to scrutinize the areas where their perspectives diverge, converge and complement one another in varying dimensions of case study research. I aim to help the emerging researchers in the field of education familiarize themselves with the diverse views regarding case study that lead to a vast array of techniques and strategies, out of which they can come up with a combined perspective which best serves their research purpose.},

However, the rural-urban differences in health outcomes, healthcare use, and expenditures among insured elders following China's comprehensive healthcare reforms in 2009 remain unclear. Using the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Surveys data containing a sample of 2,624 urban and 6,297 rural residents aged 65 and older, we performed multivariable regression analyses to determine rural-urban differences in physical and psychological functions, self-reported access to care, and healthcare expenditures, after adjusting for individual socio-demographic characteristics and health conditions. Nonparametric tests were used to evaluate the changes in rural-urban differences between 2011 and 2014. Compared to rural residents, urban residents were more dependent on activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs. Urban residents reported better adequate access to care, higher adjusted total expenditures for inpatient, outpatient, and total care, and higher adjusted out-of-pocket spending for outpatient and total care. However, rural residents had higher adjusted self-payment ratios for total care. Rural-urban differences in health outcomes, adequate access to care, and self-payment ratio significantly narrowed, but rural-urban differences in healthcare expenditures significantly increased from 2011 to 2014. Our findings revealed that although health and healthcare access improved for both rural and urban older adults in China between 2011 and 2014, rural-urban differences showed mixed trends. These findings provide empirical support for China's implementation of integrated rural and urban public health insurance systems, and further suggest that inequalities in healthcare resource distribution and economic development between rural and urban areas should be addressed to further reduce the rural-urban differences.},

It is also a major cause of mortality in  the world affecting both developed and developing countries. Diagnosis and  management of sepsis are a great challenge facing neonatologists in neonatal  intensive care units due to nonspecific signs and symptoms. This study,  therefore, was aimed to determine proportion and risk factors of neonatal sepsis  at university of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital, North West Ethiopia.  RESULT: The proportion of neonatal sepsis was 11.7\%. Factors significantly  associated with neonatal sepsis were: Neonatal related factors were: Premature  rupture of membrane (AOR\,=\,2.74; 95\% Cl (1.39, 5.38), congenital anomaly  (AOR\,=\,3.14; 95\% CI (1.09, 10.28), and low Apgar score (AOR\,=\,2.69; 95\% Cl (1.37,  5.26). Maternal factors were: foul-smelling vaginal discharge (AOR\,=\,2.75; 95\% Cl  (1.40, 5.38), and Intrapartum fever (AOR\,=\,3.35; 95\% Cl (1.7, 6.62). In this  finding proportion of Neonatal sepsis was low as compared to previous studies.  Measures targeting the prevention of premature rupture of membranes and low Apgar  score need to be taken, like strengthening maternal birth preparedness and  complication readiness plans. Also, identification of congenital anomalies  earlier in pregnancy and taking measures to avoid birth injury may decrease  neonatal sepsis.},

METHOD: Using data from focus groups and discussions with a community advisory committee, they adapted an existing questionnaire to assess cancer knowledge, barriers to mammography, and cancer beliefs for use among Navajo women. Questions measuring health literacy, numeracy, self-efficacy, cancer communication, and family support were also adapted. RESULTS: The resulting questionnaire was found to have good content validity, and to be culturally and linguistically appropriate for use among Navajo women. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to consider culture and not just language when adapting existing measures for use with AI/AN (American Indian/Alaskan Native) populations. English-language versions of existing literacy measures may not be culturally appropriate for AI/AN populations, which could lead to a lack of semantic, technical, idiomatic, and conceptual equivalence, resulting in misinterpretation of study outcomes.},

METHOD: Data came from 799 participants of an ongoing cohort study. Literacy was measured using a battery of 32 questions. Clinical diagnoses were made annually following uniform structured procedures. The associations of declining literacy with incident AD dementia and MCI were tested using a joint model for longitudinal and time-to-event data. RESULTS: We observed an overall decline in total literacy score over up to 6 years of follow-up ( p {$<$} .001). Faster decline in literacy was associated with higher risks for incident AD dementia (hazard ratio = 4.526, 95\% confidence interval = [2.993, 6.843], p {$<$} .001) and incident MCI (hazard ratio = 2.971, 95\% confidence interval = [1.509, 5.849], p = .002).

Low health literacy in caregivers has the potential to impact adequate care provision, and consequently, care recipient health outcomes. The aim of the study was to systematically review literature related to health literacy of caregivers of adult care recipients, and examine its relationship with care recipient, and caregiver, health outcomes. Electronic databases were searched for relevant English-language publications that assessed health literacy in caregivers. Included studies were abstracted into evidence tables and assessed using an eight-item quality scale. The search identified 2717 new titles and abstracts, with 67 shortlisted for full review. Twelve papers from 2003 to 2015 met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of limited health literacy in caregivers ranged from 0\% to 52.5\% depending on the measure and cut-off criteria used. Associations were found between low caregiver health literacy and (i) poorer care recipient self-management behaviours; (ii) increased care recipient use of health services; and (iii) increased caregiver burden. The quality of the studies ranged from fair to excellent. Low health literacy in caregivers differed depending on the measures and scoring criteria used. Evidence to support the relationship between caregiver health literacy and care recipient, and caregiver health outcomes was limited to single studies. Recommendations for further research include: the development of caregiver health literacy measures across different populations; examination of associations between caregiver health literacy and care recipient outcomes; and the development of interventions designed to improve caregiver health literacy.},

For decades, multiple varieties of antibiotics have not only been used for therapeutic purposes but practiced prophylactically across other industries such as agriculture and animal husbandry. Uncertainty has arisen, as microbes have become resistant to common antibiotics while the host remains unaware that antibiotic resistance has emerged. The aim of this review is to explore the origin, development, and the current state of antibiotic resistance, regulation, and challenges by examining available literature. We found that antibiotic resistance is increasing at an alarming rate. A growing list of infections i.e., pneumonia, tuberculosis, and gonorrhea are becoming harder and at times impossible to treat while antibiotics are becoming less effective. Antibiotic-resistant infections correlate with the level of antibiotic consumption. Non-judicial use of antibiotics is mostly responsible for making the microbes resistant. The antibiotic treatment repertoire for existing or emerging hard-to-treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections is limited, resulting in high morbidity and mortality report. This review article reiterates the optimal use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health to reduce antibiotic resistance. Evidence from the literature suggests that the knowledge regarding antibiotic resistance in the population is still scarce. Therefore, the need of educating patients and the public is essential to fight against the antimicrobial resistance battle.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although physical activity (PA) is crucial for health, the literature is mixed about how individuals' PA decisions are affected by their spouses. To fill this gap, we examined the extent to which providing care for one spouse affects the PA of the other spouse among those aged 50 or older in the United States. METHODS: We analyzed 9,173 older adults living with their spouses or partners from the 2004 to 2016 waves of the Health and Retirement Study. To identify the causal effect of spousal caregiving on the PA of older adults, we estimated individual-fixed effects models using a two-stage least squared instrumental variable approach with spousal falls as our instrument. We also estimated the models by splitting the sample by gender and race/ethnicity to identify heterogeneous impacts of spousal caregiving on PA decisions among subgroups. RESULTS: We found that a one percentage point increase in the probability of providing care to spouses led to an increase in the probability of initiating moderate or vigorous PA (MVPA) by 0.34-0.52 percentage points. This effect was salient, especially among female and non-Hispanic white older adults. DISCUSSION: Caregiving experience might provide opportunities to learn about caregiving burdens and trigger an emotional response about the salience of an event (i.e., they need care in the future). Older caregivers might start MVPA in an effort to improve or maintain their health and avoid burdening their families for caregiving in the future. This study demonstrated spousal influence on PA. Instead of delivering PA-promotion information (e.g., the harm of sedentary lifestyle and benefits of regular PA) to individuals, risk communication and education efforts on PA promotion might be more effective considering the family context. Family events such as health shocks or the emergence of caregiving needs from family members provide windows of opportunities for intervening. Subgroup differences should also be considered in targeted interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is one of the major public health problems globally, particularly, in developing countries. Klebsiella, Staphylococcus aureus,  Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Escherichia coli are the common pathogens  for neonatal sepsis in developing countries. However, the pooled estimate of  common pathogens causing neonatal sepsis in developing countries is still  unknown. Therefore, this study is aimed at computing the pooled proportion of the  leading cause of pathogens for neonatal sepsis in developing countries. METHODS:  We strictly followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and  Meta-analysis guidelines to report this systematic review and meta-analysis.  PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, Science Direct, and other  search engines such as Google Scholar, Africa Journals Online, and Hinari were  used to obtain studies related to the leading cause of pathogens for neonatal  sepsis in developing countries. The search was done from October 1 to December  30, 2018, by considering both published and gray literature. Studies were  evaluated based on the PRISMA guideline checklist by using their titles,  abstracts, and full texts. Studies were extracted using Microsoft Excel  spreadsheets, and STATA software version 14 was used to analyze data.  Heterogeneity between studies was checked based on Cochran's Q-test and the  corresponding I (2) statistic test. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of the leading  cause of pathogens of neonatal sepsis in developing countries were Klebsiella  (26.36\%), Staphylococcus aureus (23.22\%), Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus  (23.22\%), and Escherichia coli (15.30\%). Common pathogens were varied across  regions; for instance, pooled isolated Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was  25.98\% in Africa, 16.62\% in Asia, and 36.71\% in Latin America, and Klebsiella was  29.80\% in Africa, 23.21\% in Asia, and 22.00\% in Latin America. Also,  Staphylococcus aureus was 27.87\% in Africa and 18.28\% in Asia, and Escherichia  coli was 22.97\% in Asia and 9.43\% in Africa. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights  that the more prevalent common isolated pathogens in developing countries were  Klebsiella, Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Staphylococcus aureus pathogens were  predominantly high in Africa as compared to other Asian and Latin American  countries. At the same time, Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was more prevalent  in Latin America compared to other regions. Escherichia coli is more dominant in  Asia as compared to Africa and Latin America.},

We performed a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to quantitatively evaluate the associations in the general population. Methods:: We searched PubMed, Embase and MEDLINE from inception to Jan. 1, 2015. We used a random-effects model to combine study-specific relative risks and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). We used restricted cubic spline functions to assess the dose--response relation. Results:: A total of 46 studies were included in the meta-analysis, involving 1 246 203 patients and 78 349 deaths for all-cause mortality, and 848 320 patients and 25 800 deaths for cardiovascular mortality. The relative risk with 10 beats/min increment of resting heart rate was 1.09 (95\% CI 1.07--1.12) for all-cause mortality and 1.08 (95\% CI 1.06--1.10) for cardiovascular mortality. Compared with the lowest category, patients with a resting heart rate of 60--80 beats/min had a relative risk of 1.12 (95\% CI 1.07--1.17) for all-cause mortality and 1.08 (95\% CI 0.99--1.17) for cardiovascular mortality, and those with a resting heart rate of greater than 80 beats/min had a relative risk of 1.45 (95\% CI 1.34--1.57) for all-cause mortality and 1.33 (95\% CI 1.19--1.47) for cardiovascular mortality. Overall, the results did not differ after adjustment for traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Compared with 45 beats/min, the risk of all-cause mortality increased significantly with increasing resting heart rate in a linear relation, but a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular mortality was observed at 90 beats/min. Substantial heterogeneity and publication bias were detected. Interpretation:: Higher resting heart rate was independently associated with increased risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. This indicates that resting heart rate is a predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the general population.},

However, as both academic interests and practical efforts have mainly focused on reducing underuse, our understanding of overuse is far from complete. This study aims to analyze the status of overuse of health care services in China and explore both the supply- and demand-side factors associated with overuse. We took common cold, a self-limiting viral infection which requires no injections or infusions, as a tracer condition. Based on data from the fourth and fifth Health Service Survey of Shaanxi Province, we generated an observable indicator to measure overuse: whether or not a patient received infusion treatment for common cold during outpatient visits. The statistics showed that 58.73\% and 37.56\% of patients had infusion treatment for common cold during outpatient visits in 2008 and 2013, respectively. Based on this dependent variable, we employed Probit analysis to investigate factors influencing the overuse of health care services. The multivariate regression results showed that on the demand side, overuse was positively associated with low health literacy, long duration of illness, large family size, and high economic status. On the supply side, overuse was relatively high in hospitals at the county level and above as well as in cities with relatively low density of health care workforce. Our results also provided some evidence for the effectiveness of health care reform policies like the essential medicines programme in reducing overuse.},

  abstract = {Background High body mass index (BMI) plays a critical role in the initiation and development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Up to now, far too little attention has been paid to the global burden of T2D attributable to high BMI. This study aims to report the deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of T2D related to high BMI in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Methods Data on T2D burden attributable to high BMI were retrieved from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019. The global cases, age-standardized rates of mortality (ASMR), and disability-adjusted life years (ASDR) attributable to high BMI were estimated by age, sex, geographical location, and socio-demographic index (SDI). The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to quantify the trends of ASMR and ASDR during the period 1990--2019. Results Globally, there were 619,494.8 deaths and 34,422,224.8 DALYs of T2D attributed to high BMI in 2019, more than triple in 1990. Moreover, the pace of increase in ASMR and ASDR accelerated during 1990--2019, with EAPC of 1.36 (95\% CI: 1.27 to 1.45) and 2.13 (95\% CI: 2.10 to 2.17) separately, especially in men, South Asia, and low-middle SDI regions. Oceania was the high-risk area of standardized T2D deaths and DALYs attributable to high BMI in 2019, among which Fiji was the country with the heaviest burden. In terms of SDI, middle SDI regions had the biggest T2D-related ASMR and ASDR in 2019. Conclusion The global deaths and DALYs of T2D attributable to high BMI substantially increased from 1990 to 2019. High BMI as a major public health problem needs to be tackled properly and timely in patients with T2D.},

In comparison with the youth, older people are more likely to suffer from multimorbidity and polypharmacy, both of which are associated with adverse outcomes and increased healthcare costs. This study aimed to investigate the status of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in a large sample of hospitalized older patients aged 60 years and over.                                         Methods               A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among 46,799 eligible patients aged 60 years and over, who were hospitalized from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Multimorbidity was defined as the presence of 2 or more morbidities in one patient during the stay in hospital, and polypharmacy as prescription of 5 or more different oral medications. Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship of factors with the number of morbidities or oral medications. Odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) were estimated from logistic regression models to determine the predictors for polypharmacy and all-cause death.                                         Results               The prevalence of multimorbidity was 91.07\% and increased with age. The prevalence of polypharmacy was 56.32\%. Older age, polypharmacy, prolonged length of stay (LOS), higher cost on medications were significantly associated with an increased number of morbidities (all P\,{$<$}\,0.01). The number of morbidities (OR\,=\,1.29, 95\% CI: 1.208--1.229) and LOS (OR\,=\,1.171, 95\% CI: 1.166--1.177) were potential risk factors for polypharmacy. As for all-cause death, age (OR\,=\,1.107, 95\% CI: 1.092--1.122), number of morbidities (OR\,=\,1.495, 95\% CI: 1.435--1.558) and LOS (OR\,=\,1.020, 95\% CI: 1.013--1.027) were the potential risk factors, but the number of medications (OR\,=\,0.930, 95\% CI: 0.907--0.952) and polypharmacy (OR\,=\,0.764, 95\% CI: 0.608--0.960) were associated with a reduction of mortality.                                         Conclusion               Morbidities and LOS might be predictors for polypharmacy and all-cause death. The number of oral medications was inversely associated with the risk of all-cause mortality. Appropriate polypharmacy was beneficial for the clinical outcomes of older patients during hospitalization.},

Identifying the factors that determine depressive symptoms is crucial for the design of effective policy interventions. This study aims to examine the associations between health literacy and depressive symptoms among medical students, and to evaluate the effect of different types of social support as a potential mediator. A cross-sectional survey of medical students was conducted through convenience sampling in East China. Associations between variables were explored using OLS and the mediation effect was estimated using the Karlson, Holm and Breen method. A total of 746 valid questionnaires were collected. The prevalence of depressive symptoms among the sample was 32.4\%. Higher health literacy levels and social supports were significantly associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms. Social support partially mediated the association between health literacy and depressive symptoms, accounting for a 54.03\% of the total effect size. These findings suggest that interventions for medical student mental wellbeing could improve health literacy. Whilst family support reflects greatest impact, Universities can also lead and innovate novel interventions for this critical stage of life. Future research can extend this study by exploring the dynamic interactions between health literacy, depressive symptoms, and other sources of social support. Comparisons of these findings across the different regions of China and in other university subject disciplines are also warranted.},

SETTING/DATA SOURCE: CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE from 2011 to 2015. PARTICIPANTS: All studies of 28-day and 30-day readmission predictive model. OUTCOME MEASURES: Characteristics of the included studies, performance of the identified predictive models and key predictive variables included in the models. RESULTS: Of 7310 records, a total of 60 studies with 73 unique predictive models met the inclusion criteria. The utilisation outcome of the models included all-cause readmissions, cardiovascular disease including pneumonia, medical conditions, surgical conditions and mental health condition-related readmissions. Overall, a wide-range C-statistic was reported in 56/60 studies (0.21-0.88). 11 of 13 predictive models for medical condition-related readmissions were found to have consistent moderate discrimination ability (C-statistic {$\geq$}0.7). Only two models were designed for the potentially preventable/avoidable readmissions and had C-statistic {$>$}0.8. The variables 'comorbidities', 'length of stay' and 'previous admissions' were frequently cited across 73 models. The variables 'laboratory tests' and 'medication' had more weight in the models for cardiovascular disease and medical condition-related readmissions. CONCLUSIONS: The predictive models which focused on general medical condition-related unplanned hospital readmissions reported moderate discriminative ability. Two models for potentially preventable/avoidable readmissions showed high discriminative ability. This updated systematic review, however, found inconsistent performance across the included unique 73 risk predictive models. It is critical to define clearly the utilisation outcomes and the type of accessible data source before the selection of the predictive model. Rigorous validation of the predictive models with moderate-to-high discriminative ability is essential, especially for the two models for the potentially preventable/avoidable readmissions. Given the limited available evidence, the development of a predictive model specifically for paediatric 28-day all-cause, unplanned hospital readmissions is a high priority.},

  abstract = {Clinical trials had provided evidence for the benefit effect of antihypertensive treatments in preventing future cardiovascular disease (CVD) events; however, the association between hypertension, whether treated/untreated or controlled/uncontrolled and risk of mortality in US population has been poorly understood. A total of 13,947 US adults aged {$\geq$}18 years enrolled in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) were used to conduct this study. Mortality outcome events included all-cause, CVD-specific, heart disease-specific and cerebrovascular disease-specific deaths, which were obtained from linked 2011 National Death Index (NDI) files. During a median follow-up of 19.1 years, there were 3,550 all-cause deaths, including 1,027 CVD deaths. Compared with normotensives, treated but uncontrolled hypertensive patients were at higher risk of all-cause (HR\,=\,1.62, 95\%CI\,=\,1.35-1.95), CVD-specific (HR\,=\,2.23, 95\%CI\,=\,1.66-2.99), heart disease-specific (HR\,=\,2.19, 95\%CI\,=\,1.57-3.05) and cerebrovascular disease-specific (HR\,=\,3.01, 95\%CI\,=\,1.91-4.73) mortality. Additionally, untreated hypertensive patients had increased risk of all-cause (HR\,=\,1.40, 95\%CI\,=\,1.21-1.62), CVD-specific (HR\,=\,1.77, 95\%CI\,=\,1.34-2.35), heart disease-specific (HR\,=\,1.69, 95\%CI\,=\,1.23-2.32) and cerebrovascular disease-specific death (HR\,=\,2.53, 95\%CI\,=\,1.52-4.23). No significant differences were identified between normotensives, and treated and controlled hypertensives (all p\,{$>$}\,0.05). Our study findings emphasize the benefit of secondary prevention in hypertensive patients and primary prevention in general population to prevent risk of mortality later in life.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effects of 2 different health-promoting interventions on physical performance, fear of falling, and physical activity at 3-month, 1-year, and 2-year follow-ups of the study Elderly Persons in the Risk Zone. DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized, three-armed, single-blind, and controlled study in which 459 independent and community-dwelling people aged 80 years or older were included. A single preventive home visit including health-promoting information and advice and 4 weekly senior group meetings focused on health strategies and peer learning, with a follow-up home visit, were compared with control. Functional balance, walking speed, fear of falling, falls efficacy, and frequency of physical activities were measured 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after baseline. RESULTS: There were no or limited differences between the groups at the 3-month and 1-year follow-ups. At 2 years, the odds ratio for having a total score of 48 or more on the Berg Balance scale compared with control was 1.80 (confidence interval 1.11-2.90) for a preventive home visit and 1.96 (confidence interval 1.21-3.17) for the senior meetings. A significantly larger proportion of intervention participants than controls maintained walking speed and reported higher falls efficacy. At 1 and 2 years, a significantly higher proportion of intervention participants performed regular physical activities than control. IMPLICATIONS: Both a preventive home visit and senior meetings reduced the deterioration in functional balance, walking speed, and falls efficacy after 2 years. The long-term effects of both interventions indicate a positive impact on postponement of physical frailty among independent older people.},

The aim of this study was to investigate how distance to hospital and socioeconomic status (SES) influence the use of secondary health care (SHC) when taking comorbidity into account. Design and setting. A register-based study in {\"O}sterg{\"o}tland County. Subjects. The adult population of {\"O}sterg{\"o}tland County. Main outcome measures. Odds of SHC use in the population and rates of SHC use by patients were studied after taking into account comorbidity level assigned using the Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) Case-Mix System. The baseline for analysis of SES was individuals with the lowest education level (level 1) and the lowest income (1st quartile). Results. The study showed both positive and negative association between SES and use of SHC. The risk of incurring SHC costs was 12\% higher for individuals with education level 1. Individuals with income in the 2nd quartile had a 4\% higher risk of incurring SHC costs but a 17\% lower risk of emergency department visits. Individuals with income in the ...},

  abstract = {Gastrointestinal and respiratory infections in children attending daycare centres (DCCs) are common and compliance with hand hygiene (HH) guidelines to prevent infections is generally low. An intervention was developed to increase HH compliance and reduce infections in DCCs. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on HH compliance. The intervention was evaluated in a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial in 71 DCCs in The Netherlands. Thirty-six DCCs received the intervention including: (1) HH products; (2) training about HH guidelines; (3) two team training sessions aimed at goal setting and formulating HH improvement activities; and (4) reminders and cues for action (posters/stickers). Intervention DCCs were compared to 35 control DCCs that continued usual practice. HH compliance of caregivers and children was observed at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months follow-up. Using multilevel logistic regression, odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained for the intervention effect. Of 795 caregivers, 5042 HH opportunities for caregivers and 5606 opportunities for supervising children's HH were observed. At 1 month follow-up caregivers' compliance in intervention DCCs was 66\% vs. 43\% in control DCCs (OR 6{$\cdot$}33, 95\% CI 3{$\cdot$}71--10{$\cdot$}80), and at 6 months 59\% vs. 44\% (OR 4{$\cdot$}13, 95\% CI 2{$\cdot$}33--7{$\cdot$}32). No effect of the intervention was found on supervising children's HH (36\% vs. 32\%; OR 0{$\cdot$}64, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}18--2{$\cdot$}33). In conclusion, HH compliance of caregivers increased due to the intervention, therefore dissemination of the intervention can be considered.},
