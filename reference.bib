  abstract = {Gastrointestinal and respiratory infections in children attending daycare centres (DCCs) are common and compliance with hand hygiene (HH) guidelines to prevent infections is generally low. An intervention was developed to increase HH compliance and reduce infections in DCCs. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on HH compliance. The intervention was evaluated in a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial in 71 DCCs in The Netherlands. Thirty-six DCCs received the intervention including: (1) HH products; (2) training about HH guidelines; (3) two team training sessions aimed at goal setting and formulating HH improvement activities; and (4) reminders and cues for action (posters/stickers). Intervention DCCs were compared to 35 control DCCs that continued usual practice. HH compliance of caregivers and children was observed at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months follow-up. Using multilevel logistic regression, odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained for the intervention effect. Of 795 caregivers, 5042 HH opportunities for caregivers and 5606 opportunities for supervising children's HH were observed. At 1 month follow-up caregivers' compliance in intervention DCCs was 66\% vs. 43\% in control DCCs (OR 6{$\cdot$}33, 95\% CI 3{$\cdot$}71--10{$\cdot$}80), and at 6 months 59\% vs. 44\% (OR 4{$\cdot$}13, 95\% CI 2{$\cdot$}33--7{$\cdot$}32). No effect of the intervention was found on supervising children's HH (36\% vs. 32\%; OR 0{$\cdot$}64, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}18--2{$\cdot$}33). In conclusion, HH compliance of caregivers increased due to the intervention, therefore dissemination of the intervention can be considered.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE This study attempts to determine the associations between postdischarge environmental (PDE) and socioeconomic (SES) factors and early readmission to hospitals. DESIGN AND METHODS This study was a cohort study using the 2001 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey and Medicare claims for the period from 2001 to 2002. The participants were community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries admitted to hospitals, discharged home, and surviving at least 1 year after discharge (n = 1,351). The study measurements were early readmission (within 60 days), PDE factors, and SES factors. PDE factors consisted of having a usual source of care, requiring assistance to see the usual source of care, marital status, living alone, lacking self-management skills, having unmet functional need, having no helpers with activities of daily living, number of living children, and number of levels in the home. SES factors consisted of education, income, and Medicaid enrollment. RESULTS Of the 1,351 beneficiaries, 202 (15.0\%) experienced an early readmission. After adjustment for demographics, health, and functional status, the odds of early readmission were increased by living alone (odds ratio or OR = 1.50, 95\% confidence interval or CI = 1.01-2.24), having unmet functional need (OR = 1.48, 95\% CI = 1.04-2.10), lacking self-management skills (OR = 1.44, 95\% CI = 1.03-2.02), and having limited education (OR = 1.42, 95\% CI = 1.01-2.02). IMPLICATIONS These findings suggest that PDE and SES factors are associated with early readmission. Considering these findings may enhance the targeting of pre-discharge and postdischarge interventions to avert early readmission. Such interventions may include home health services, patient activation, and comprehensive discharge planning.},
